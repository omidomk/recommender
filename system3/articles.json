However, many candidate non-precious metal catalysts bind hydrogen with similar strengths, but exhibit orders-of-magnitude lower activity for this reaction. In this study, we employ newly-developed electronic structure methods that allow fully potential-dependent reaction barriers to be calculated, in order to develop a complete working picture of hydrogen evolution on platinum. Through the resulting ab initio microkinetic models, we assess the mechanistic origins of Pt's high activity. We find that the G~0 hydrogen atoms are kinetically inert, and that the kinetically active hydrogen atoms have G's much weaker, similar to that of gold. These on-top hydrogens have particularly low barriers, which we compare to those of gold, explaining the high reaction rates, and the exponential variations in coverages can uniquely explain Pt's strong kinetic response to the applied potential. This explains the unique reactivity of Pt that is missed by conventional Sabatier analyses, and suggests true design criteria for non-precious alternatives.

The model learns to extract the probabilistic structures hidden in fluctuating temporal patterns by dynamically changing the stochasticity of its latent states. Its architecture attempts to address two major concerns of variational Bayes RNNs: how can latent variables learn meaningful representations and how can the inference model transfer future observations to the latent variables. PV-RNN does both by introducing adaptive vectors mirroring the training data, whose values can then be adapted differently during evaluation. Moreover, prediction errors during backpropagation, rather than external inputs during the forward computation, are used to convey information to the network about the external data. For testing, we introduce error regression for predicting unseen sequences as inspired by predictive coding that leverages those mechanisms. The model introduces a weighting parameter, the meta-prior, to balance the optimization pressure placed on two terms of a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the sequential data. We test the model on two datasets with probabilistic structures and show that with high values of the meta-prior the network develops deterministic chaos through which the data's randomness is imitated. For low values, the model behaves as a random process. The network performs best on intermediate values, and is able to capture the latent probabilistic structure with good generalization. Analyzing the meta-prior's impact on the network allows to precisely study the theoretical value and practical benefits of incorporating stochastic dynamics in our model. We demonstrate better prediction performance on a robot imitation task with our model using error regression compared to a standard variational Bayes model lacking such a procedure.

The codes are defined by evaluating functions with poles at a given point $Q$ in points $P_1,\\dots,P_n$ distinct from $Q$. A flag has the isometry-dual property if the given flag and the corresponding dual flag are the same up to isometry. For several curves, including the projective line, Hermitian curves, Suzuki curves, Ree curves, and the Klein curve over the field of eight elements, the maximal flag, obtained by evaluation in all rational points different from the point $Q$, is self-dual. More generally, we ask whether a flag obtained by evaluation in a proper subset of rational points is isometry-dual. In [3] it is shown, for a curve of genus $g$, that a flag of one-point AG codes defined with a subset of $n > 2g+2$ rational points is isometry-dual if and only if the last code $C_n$ in the flag is defined with functions of pole order at most $n+2g-1$. Using a different approach, we extend this characterization to all subsets of size $n \\geq 2g+2$. Moreover we show that this is best possible by giving examples of isometry-dual flags with $n=2g+1$ such that $C_n$ is generated by functions of pole order at most $n+2g-2$. We also prove a necessary condition, formulated in terms of maximum sparse ideals of the Weierstrass semigroup of $Q$, under which a flag of punctured one-point AG codes inherits the isometry-dual property from the original unpunctured flag.

Traditional skill learning has revolved around reinforcement and imitation learning, each with their own constraints on the format and temporal distribution with which information between the human and the agent is exchanged. In contrast, when humans communicate with each other, they make use of a large vocabulary of informative behaviors, including non-verbal communication, which help to disambiguate their message throughout learning. Communicating throughout learning allows them to identify any missing information, whereas the large vocabulary of behaviors helps with selecting appropriate behaviors for communicating the required information. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent training framework, which emerges physical information-communicating behaviors. The agent is trained, on a variety of tasks, with another agent, who knows the task and serves as a human surrogate. Our approach produces an agent that is capable of learning interactively from a human user, without a set of explicit demonstrations or a reward function. We conduct user experiments on object gathering tasks with pixel observations, and confirm that the trained agent learns from the human and that the joint performance significantly exceeds the performance of the human acting alone. Further, through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the emergence of a variety of learning behaviors, including information-sharing, information-seeking, and question-answering.

We develop a network-based model of trabecular bone by creating graphs from micro-computed tomography images of human bone, with weighted links representing trabeculae and nodes representing branch points. These graphs enable calculation of quantitative network metrics to characterize trabecular structure. We also create finite element models of the networks in which each link is represented by a beam, facilitating analysis of the mechanical response of the bone samples to simulated loading. We examine the structural and mechanical properties of trabecular bone at the scale of individual trabeculae (of order 0.1 mm) and at the scale of selected volumes of interest (approximately a few mm), referred to as VOIs. At the VOI scale, we find significant correlations between the stiffness of VOIs and 10 different structural metrics. Individually, the volume fraction of each VOI is most strongly correlated to the stiffness of the VOI. We use multiple linear regression to identify the smallest subset of variables needed to capture the variation in stiffness.

While the hallucinations can be drug-induced, it has been described that they can even be provoked in healthy subjects. Understanding their manifestation could thus unveil how the brain processes sensory information and might evidence the generative nature of perception. In this work, we investigate the generation of tactile hallucinations on biologically inspired, artificial skin. To model tactile hallucinations, we apply homeostasis, a change in the excitability of neurons during sensory deprivation, in a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). We find that homeostasis prompts hallucinations of previously learned patterns on the artificial skin in the absence of sensory input. Moreover, we show that homeostasis is capable of inducing the formation of meaningful latent representations in a DBM and that it significantly increases the quality of the reconstruction of these latent states. Through this, our work provides a possible explanation for the nature of tactile hallucinations and highlights homeostatic processes as a potential underlying mechanism.

Inference in this grammar is performed by collapsed variational inference, in which an amortized variational posterior is placed on the continuous variable, and the latent trees are marginalized with dynamic programming.

While being effective, these constrained decoding methods add, however, significant computational overhead to the inference step, and, as we show in this paper, can be brittle when tested in realistic conditions. In this paper we approach the problem by training a neural MT system to learn how to use custom terminology when provided with the input.

To represent the tidal responses of rotating planets, we employ series expansions in terms of spherical harmonic functions $Y_l^m$ with different $l$s for a given $m$. For low forcing frequency, there occurs frequency resonance between the forcing and the $g$- and $r$-modes in the envelope and inertial modes in the core. We find that the resonance enhances the tidal torque, and that the resonance with the $g$- and $r$-modes produces broad peaks and that with the inertial modes very sharp peaks, depending on the magnitude of the non-adiabatic effects associated with the oscillation modes. We also find that the behavior of the tidal torque as a function of the forcing frequency (or period) is different between prograde and retrograde forcing, particularly for long forcing periods because the $r$-modes, which have long periods, exist only on the retrograde side.

The observed iron K-edge exhibits a maximum optical depth, when the X-ray continuum dims, and there is no significant pulse phase variation in the ionization state of iron. The revealed changes in the optical depth with pulse phase can be explained as being due to the accreting matter captured by the magnetic field lines of the pulsar, which co-rotates with the neutron star spin and is responsible for photoelectric absorption. Based on the above interpretation, we propose that the accreting matter within the Alfv\\'en radius contains iron with an ionization state of Fe$_{\\rm V\\hspace{-0.1em}I-X\\hspace{-0.1em}I}$ with a particle density of $10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and has a shape flattened along the azimuthal direction, such as an accretion curtain.

In this way, embedding module performs as the representative learning and plays a key role in the model performance. However, in many real-world applications, deep CTR model often suffers from poor generalization performance, which is mostly due to the learning of embedding parameters.

(ii) Following our theoretical analysis, we design a new embedding structure named res-embedding. In res-embedding module, embedding vector of each item is the sum of two components: (i) a central embedding vector calculated from an item-based interest graph (ii) a residual embedding vector with its scale to be relatively small. Empirical evaluation on several public datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed res-embedding structure, which brings significant improvement on the model performance.

We first give the general solutions for all integral transforms, prove that they are the best solutions, and then apply them to the case of EB-leakage and detection of the CGW. In the upcoming decade, all cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments are ground based, so they provide only partial sky coverage. Within this context, the EB-leakage becomes inevitable.

Scaling relations between cluster properties embody the formation and evolution of cosmic structure. Intrinsic scatters and correlations between X-ray properties are determined from merger history, baryonic processes, and dynamical state.   Aims. We look for an unbiased measurement of the scatter covariance matrix between the three main X-ray observable quantities attainable in large X-ray surveys -- temperature, luminosity, and gas mass. This also gives us the cluster property with the lowest conditional intrinsic scatter at fixed mass.   Methods. Intrinsic scatters and correlations can be measured under the assumption that the observable properties of the intra-cluster medium hosted in clusters are log-normally distributed around power-law scaling relations. The proposed method is self-consistent, based on minimal assumptions, and requires neither the external calibration by weak lensing, dynamical, or hydrostatic masses nor the knowledge of the mass completeness.   Results. We analyzed the 100 brightest clusters detected in the XXL Survey and their X-ray properties measured within a fixed radius of 300 kpc. The gas mass is the less scattered proxy (~8%). The temperature (~20%) is intrinsically less scattered than the luminosity (~30%) but it is measured with a larger observational uncertainty. We found some evidence that gas mass, temperature and luminosity are positively correlated. Time-evolutions are in agreement with the self-similar scenario, but the luminosity-temperature and the gas mass-temperature relations are steeper.   Conclusions. Positive correlations between X-ray properties can be determined by the dynamical state and the merger history of the halos. The slopes of the scaling relations are affected by radiative processes.

Regression depth (RD) of Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999), the most famous, exemplifies a direct extension of Tukey location depth (Tukey (1975)) to regression. The extension of another prevailing location depth, the projection depth (Liu (1992), and Zuo and Serfling (2000)), to regression is called the projection regression depth (PRD) (Zuo (2018a)(Z18a)). These two represent the most promising depth notions in regression (Z18a). Carrizosa depth $D_C$ (Carrizosa (1996)) is another notion of depth in regression.   The most remarkable advantage of the notion of depth in regression is to introduce directly, the median-type estimator, the maximum (or deepest) regression depth estimator (regression median) for regression parameters in a multi-dimensional setting. The maximum (deepest) regression depth estimators (regression medians) serve as robust alternatives to the classical least squares or least absolute deviations estimator of the unknown parameters in a general linear regression model.   The uniqueness of regression medians is central in the discussion of the asymptotics of sample regression medians and a desirable property for the convergence of approximate algorithm in the computation of sample regression medians. Are the regression medians induced from RD, PRD, and $D_C$ unique? Answering this question is the goal of this article.   It is found that the regression median induced from PRD possesses the uniqueness property, unlike its leading competitors. This and other findings on the performance of PRD and its induced median indicate that the PRD and its induced median are highly favorable among its leading competitors.

The theory describes Lorentz covariant electrodynamics of superconductors where Anderson-Higgs mechanism and Higgs effect occur, in the same time the dynamics of conduction electrons remains nonrelativistic. In addition we consider Goldstone modes and features of Anderson-Higgs mechanism in two-band superconductors. Due to Lorentz covariance magnetostatics and electrostatics acquire symmetrical forms, but with essential features. It is demonstrated that due to spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry the specific ponderomotive forces appear which compensate the electrostatic and Ampere forces acting on a charge, so that the London-like laws take place for both electrostatic and magnetic fields. Thus the electrostatic field, like magnetic field, can penetrate a superconductor on the macroscopic depth without causing acceleration of the supercurrent. In addition we study dissipative processes, which are caused by movement of the normal component of electron liquid and violate the Lorentz covariance of the initial field equations, on the examples of the damping of oscillations of the order parameter and the skin-effect for electromagnetic field.

Despite recent attention, no exact Bayesian PNM for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed. This raises the fundamental question of whether exact Bayesian methods for (in general nonlinear) ODEs even exist. The purpose of this paper is to provide a positive answer for a limited class of ODE. To this end, we work at a foundational level, where a novel Bayesian PNM is proposed as a proof-of-concept.

This is done by employing peer-to-peer data transfers to supplement the resources of the network infrastructure. However, these hybrid systems are vulnerable to accounting attacks in which the peers, or caches, collude with clients in order to report that content was transferred when it was not. This is a particular issue in systems that incentivize cache participation, because malicious caches may collect rewards from the content publishers operating the CDN without doing any useful work.   In this paper, we introduce CAPnet, the first technique that lets untrusted caches join a peer-assisted CDN while providing a bound on the effectiveness of accounting attacks. At its heart is a lightweight cache accountability puzzle that clients must solve before caches are given credit. This puzzle requires colocating the data a client has requested, so its solution confirms that the content (or at least an amount of data within a pre-configured bound) has actually been retrieved. We analyze the security and overhead of our scheme in realistic scenarios. The results show that a modest client machine using a single core can solve puzzles at a rate sufficient to simultaneously watch dozens of 1080p videos. The technique is designed to be even more scalable on the server side. In our experiments, one core of a single low-end machine is able to generate puzzles for 4.26 Tbps of bandwidth - enabling 870,000 clients to concurrently view the same 1080p video. This demonstrates that our scheme can ensure cache accountability without degrading system productivity.

Our approach mainly focuses on learning feature embeddings in an end-to-end way, which can generalize well to the trackers based on online discriminatively trained ridge regression model. This goal is efficiently achieved by taking advantage of the following two important theories. 1) Ridge regression problem has closed-form solution and is implicit differentiation under the optimality condition. Therefore, its solver can be embedded as a layer with efficient forward and backward processes in training deep convolutional neural networks. 2) Woodbury identity can be utilized to ensure efficient solution of ridge regression problem when the high-dimensional feature embeddings are employed. Moreover, in order to address the extreme foreground-background class imbalance during training, we modify the origin shrinkage loss and then employ it as the loss function for efficient and effective training.

We find that with the introduction of a small viscosity in a sub-Keplerian flow, much like the wind accretion in HMXBs such as Cir X-1, only a single Normal Boundary Layer (NBOL) forms to adjust the rotational velocity component. With the increase of viscosity, the region extends radially and beyond some critical value, a RAdiative KEplerian Disk/layer (RAKED) forms between the sub-Keplerian flow and the NBOL. When viscosity is increased further only NBOL and RAKED remain. In all such cases, the CENtrifugal pressure dominated BOundary Layer (CENBOL) is formed, away from the star, as in the case of black holes. This is the first self-consistent study where such a transition from sub-Keplerian flows has been reported for neutron stars. We also identify the connection between accretion and ejection of matter, following the Two-Component Advective Flow for black holes, for neutron stars.

Recent years have witnessed dramatic growth in smart vehicles and computation-intensive graph jobs, which pose new challenges to the provision of efficient services related to the Internet of Vehicles. Fortunately, vehicular clouds formed by a collection of vehicles, which allows jobs to be offloaded among vehicles, can substantially alleviate heavy on-board workloads and enable on-demand provisioning of computational resources. In this paper, we present a novel framework for vehicular clouds that maps components of graph jobs to service providers via opportunistic vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Then, graph job allocation over vehicular clouds is formulated as a non-linear integer programming with respect to vehicles' contact duration and available resources, aiming to minimize job completion time and data exchange cost. The problem is addressed for two scenarios: low-traffic and rush-hours. For the former, we determine the optimal solutions for the problem. In the latter case, given the intractable computations for deriving feasible allocations, we propose a novel low complexity randomized graph job allocation mechanism by considering hierarchical tree based subgraph isomorphism. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms through extensive simulations.

The objective of this paper is to fill this gap by proposing clear criteria and properties that aim to improve the characterization of existing and future AV approaches. Based on these properties, we conduct three experiments using 12 existing AV approaches, including the current state of the art. The examined methods were trained, optimized and evaluated on three self-compiled corpora, where each corpus focuses on a different aspect of applicability. Our results indicate that part of the methods are able to cope with very challenging verification cases such as 250 characters long informal chat conversations (72.7% accuracy) or cases in which two scientific documents were written at different times with an average difference of 15.6 years (> 75% accuracy). However, we also identified that all involved methods are prone to cross-topic verification cases.

In our analysis, the target space manifold is assumed to be smooth and Archimedean; however, the base space may be either Archimedean or ultrametric.

As the volume sampled by these near-field techniques depends mostly on the radius of the cantilever tip, typically 10 nm, it is orders of magnitude smaller than in conventional techniques. Nevertheless, comparability of nano-FTIR near-field spectra and data from macroscopic methods has been shown. Some relevant polymers such as polystyrene however, prove to be more difficult to detect than others. Furthermore, the small sampled volume suggests lower signal quality of nano-FTIR data and proof of its suitability for a reliable library search identification is lacking. To evaluate the techniques especially towards automatic and higher throughput identification of nanoscale polymers, for example in blends or environmental samples, we examined domain distributions in a PS-LDPE film and spectral responses of foils of the most relevant commercial polymers. We demonstrate the successful library search identification of all samples with nano-FTIR data measured in less than seven minutes/spectrum. We discuss aspects affecting the accuracy of the identification and show that already the small spectral range of 1700-1300 cm$^{-1}$ leads to similar success in differentiating between polymer types with near-field data as with conventional far-field FTIR spectroscopy.

However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate decisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning, but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for themselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and specialization. We experimentally demonstrate that this policy architecture improves over both flat and hierarchical policies in terms of generalization.

An electron inside a slot-waveguide cavity can strongly couple with cavity photons and exhibits vacuum Rabi oscillations. Two electrons in the cavity naturally generate entanglement through their respective coupling to the lossy cavity. The electron-in-helium system offers unique insight in understanding nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

We aim at confirming their suspected binary nature and deriving their orbital elements to investigate the impact of their orbits on the evolution of these systems. This research is embedded into a wider endeavour to study binary evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. Method: The high amplitude pulsations were cleaned from the radial-velocity data to better constrain the orbital motion. We used Gaia DR2 parallaxes in combination with the SEDs to compute their luminosities which were complemented with the ones computed using a period-luminosity-colour relation. The ratio of the circumstellar infrared flux to the photospheric flux obtained from the SEDs was used to estimate the orbital inclination of each system. Results: DF Cyg and RV Tau are binaries with spectroscopic orbital periods of 784$\\pm$16 days and 1198$\\pm$17 days, respectively. These orbital periods are found to be similar to the long-term periodic variability in the photometric time series, indicating that binarity indeed explains the long-term photometric variability. Both systems are surrounded by a circumbinary disc which is grazed by our line-of-sight. As a result, the stellar photometric flux is extinct periodically with the orbital period. Our derived orbital inclinations enabled us to obtain accurate companion masses for DF Cyg and RV Tau. Analysis of the Kepler photometry of DF Cyg revealed a power spectrum with side lobes around the fundamental pulsation frequency. This modulation corresponds to the spectroscopic orbital period and hence to the long-term photometric period. Finally we report on the evidence of high velocity absorption features related to the H$_{\\alpha}$ profile in both objects, indicating outflows launched from around the companion.

Dynamical studies suggest that most of the circumbinary discs (CBDs) should be coplanar, i.e. the rotation vectors of the binary and the disc are aligned. However, some theoretical works show that under certain conditions a CBD can become polar, i.e the rotation vector is orthogonal with respect to the binary orbital plane. Interestingly, very recent observations showed that polar CBDs exist in Nature (e.g. HD 98800). Aims. We test the predictions of CBD alignment around eccentric binaries based on linear theory. In particular, we compare prograde and retrograde CBD configurations. Then, we thoroughly characterise the orbital behaviour and stability of misaligned (P-type) particles. Methods. The evolution of the CBD alignment for various configurations is modelled through three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. For the orbital characterisation and the analysis stability, we relied on long-term N-body integrations and structure and chaos indicators, such as $\\Delta e$ and MEGNO. Results. We confirm previous analytical predictions on CBD alignment, but find an unexpected symmetry breaking between prograde and retrograde configurations. More specifically, we observe polar alignment for a retrograde misaligned CBD that was expected to become coplanar with respect to the binary disc plane. Therefore, the likelihood of becoming polar for a highly misaligned CBD is higher than previously thought. Regarding the stability of circumbinary P-type planets (aka Tatooines), polar orbits are stable over a wide range of binary parameters. In particular, for binary eccentricities below 0.4, the orbits are stable for any value of the binary mass ratio. In the absence of gas, planets with masses below $10^{-5}$ $M_{\\odot}$ have negligible effects on the binary orbit.

Methods:Multi-shot EPI methods can enable higher spatial resolution for diffusion MRI studies. Traditionally, such acquisitions required specialized reconstructions involving phase compensation to correct for inter-shot motion artifacts. The recently proposed MUSSELS reconstruction belongs to a new class of parallel imaging-based methods that recover artifact-free DWIs from msDW data without needing phase compensation. However, computational demands of the MUSSELS reconstruction scales as the matrix size and the number of shots increases, which hinders its practical utility for high-resolution applications. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient formulation using iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. The new formulation is not only fast but it enables to accommodate additional priors such as conjugate symmetry property of the k-space data to improve the reconstruction. Using whole-brain in-vivo data, we show the utility of the new formulation for routine high-resolution studies with minimal computational burden.   Results: The IRLS formulation provides about six times faster reconstruction for matrix sizes 192x192 and 256x256, compared to the original implementations. The reconstruction quality is improved by the addition of conjugate symmetry priors that reduce blurring and preserves the high-resolution details from partial Fourier acquisitions.   Conclusion: The proposed method is shown to be computationally efficient to enable routine high-resolution studies. The computational complexity matches the traditional msDWI reconstruction methods and provides improved reconstruction results.

More than 60 years ago, it was shown that the so-called Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier, which includes an image-potential-energy term (that models exchange-and-correlation effects) is better physics. For a metal-like emitter with work-function 4.5 eV, the SN-barrier-related Murphy-Good FE equation predicts LECD values that are higher than the elementary equation values by a large factor, often between around 250 and around 500.

Moser & Tardos (2010) gave sequential and parallel algorithms which transformed most applications of the variable-assignment LLL into efficient algorithms. A framework of Harvey & Vondr\\'ak (2015) based on \"resampling oracles\" extended this give very general sequential algorithms for other probability spaces satisfying the Lopsided Lov\\'asz Local Lemma (LLLL).   We describe a new structural property of resampling oracles, which we refer to as \"obliviousness.\" Essentially, it means that the interaction between two bad-events $B, B'$ depends only on the randomness used to resample $B$, and not on the precise state within $B$ itself.   This property has two major benefits. First, it is the key to achieving a unified parallel LLLL algorithm, which is faster than previous, problem-specific algorithms of Harris (2016) for the variable-assignment LLLL algorithm and of Harris & Srinivasan (2014) for permutations. This gives the first RNC algorithms for perfect matchings and hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$.   Second, this property allows us to build LLLL probability spaces out of a relatively simple \"atomic\" set of events. It was intuitively clear that existing LLLL spaces were built in this way, but the obliviousness property formalizes this and gives a way of automatically turning a resampling oracle for atomic events into a resampling oracle for conjunctions of them. Using this framework, we get the first sequential resampling oracle for perfect matchings on the complete $s$-uniform hypergraph $K_n^{(s)}$, and the first commutative resampling oracle for hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$.

This problem contains two sets of fundamentally different preferential flow regimes; the first is caused by the viscous fingering and the second is due to the permeability contrasts between the fractures and rock matrix. We study the transition from a regime where the flow is dominated by the viscous instabilities, to a regime where the heterogeneities induced by the fractures define the flow paths. We find that fractures greatly affect the viscous fingering, even for small permeability differences between the rock matrix and the fractures. The interaction between the viscosity contrast and permeability contrast causes channeling of the less viscous fluid through the fractures and back to the rock. This channeling stabilizes the displacement front in the rock matrix, and the viscous fingering ceases for the higher permeability contrast. Several different fracture geometries are considered, and we observe a complex interplay between the geometries and unstable flow.

This technical note focuses on three forms of two-body rescattering. Elastic hadron+nucleus scattering primarily changes the direction of the hadron with very little energy transfer. Secondly, a hadron+nucleon quasi-elastic process leads to the knockout of a single struck nucleon, possibly with charge exchange between the two hadrons. Also, a pion can be absorbed leading to the ejection of two nucleons. There was an error in the code of the {\\small GENIE} neutrino event generator that affects these processes. We present examples of the change with the fixed version of the scattering process, but also compare these specifically to turning off elastic scattering completely, which is similar to other neutrino event generator configurations or a potential Equick-fix to already generated samples. Three examples are taken from current topics of interest: transverse kinematics observables in quasielastic neutrino reactions, the pion angle with respect to the incoming and outgoing lepton for $\\Delta$ reactions with a charged pion in the final state, and the angle between two protons in reactions with no pions present. Elastic hadron+nucleus scattering in its unfixed form makes a large distortion in distributions of transverse kinematic imbalances scattering, but only mild distortion in other observables. The distortion of the other two processes is also mild for all distributions considered. The correct form of hadron+nucleus scattering process could play a role in describing the width and center of the sharp peak in the inferred Fermi-motion of the struck nucleon or be benchmarked using (e,e'p) data.

We demonstrate that this notion of compatibility between the observed and simulated summaries is critical for the performance of BSL and its variants: across several different simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate that if the assumed DGP used in BSL differs from the true DGP, BSL can yield unreliable parameter inference.

In a first step, errors that are related to spatial and temporal features of the first two moments of the temperature distribution at model scale are identified and corrected. Secondly, residual space-time dependence at the finer scale is analyzed using a statistical model, from which realizations are generated and then combined with appropriate climate change signal to form the downscaled projection fields. Using a high-resolution observational gridded data product, the proposed approach is applied in a case study where projections of two regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble are bias-corrected and downscaled to a 1x1 km grid in the Trondelag area of Norway.

This method makes no explicit assumption about the shape of brightness profile more than the flatness of the profile near the centre of the stellar disk. From the simulation, we investigate the accuracy and stability of this method and we use regularization techniques to stabilize it. Finally, we apply this method to the single lens, high magnification transit events of OGLE-2004-BLG-254 ($SAAO_I$), MOA-2007-BLG-233/OGLE-2007-BLG-302 ($OGLE_I, MOA_R$), MOA-2010-BLG-436 ($MOA_R$), MOA-2011-BLG-93 ($Canopus_V$), MOA-2011-BLG-300/OGLE-2011-BLG-0990 ($Pico_I$) and MOA-2011-BLG-325/OGLE-2011-BLG-1101 ($LT_I$) in which light curves have been observed with a high cadence near the peak \\citep{Ch}.

Lenses have been extensively studied, extended, and applied. Recent work has demonstrated how techniques from type-directed program synthesis can be used to efficiently synthesize a simple class of lenses---bijective lenses over string data---given a pair of types (regular expressions) and examples.   We extend this synthesis algorithm to a broader class of lenses, called simple symmetric lenses, including all bijective lenses, all of the popular category of \"asymmetric\" lenses, and a subset of the \"symmetric lenses\" proposed by Hofmann et al. Intuitively, simple symmetric lenses allow some information to be present on one side but not the other and vice versa. They are of independent theoretical interest, being the largest class of symmetric lenses that do not use persistent internal state.   Synthesizing simple symmetric lenses is more challenging than synthesizing bijective lenses: Since some of the information on each side can be \"disconnected\" from the other side, there will typically be many lenses that agree with a given example. To guide the search process, we use stochastic regular expressions and information theory to estimate the amount of information propagated by a candidate lens, preferring lenses that propagate more information, as well as user annotations marking parts of the source and target formats as either irrelevant or essential.   We describe an implementation of simple symmetric lenses and our synthesis procedure as extensions to the Boomerang language. We evaluate its performance on 48 benchmark examples drawn from Flash Fill, Augeas, and the bidirectional programming literature. Our implementation can synthesize each of these lenses in under 30 seconds.

When clusters collide, they create merger shocks on cosmological scales, which transform most of the kinetic energy carried by the cluster gaseous halos into heat. Observations of merger shocks provide key information of the merger dynamics, and enable insights into the formation and thermal history of the large-scale structures. Nearly all of the merger shocks are found in systems where the clusters have already collided, knowledge of shocks in the pre-merger phase is a crucial missing ingredient. Here we report on the discovery of a unique shock in a cluster pair 1E 2216 and 1E 2215. The two clusters are observed at an early phase of major merger. Contrary to all the known merger shocks observed ubiquitously on merger axes, the new shock propagates outward along the equatorial plane of the merger. This discovery uncovers an important epoch in the formation of massive clusters, when the rapid approach of the cluster pair leads to strong compression of gas along the merger axis. Current theoretical models predict that the bulk of the shock energy might be dissipated outside the clusters, and eventually turn into heat of the pristine gas in the circum-cluster space.

In this setting, we study the problem of two camps aiming to maximize adoption of their respective opinions, by strategically investing on nodes in the two phases. A node's initial opinion in the second phase naturally plays a key role in determining the final opinion of that node, and hence also of other nodes in the network due to its influence on them. More importantly, this bias also determines the effectiveness of a camp's investment on that node in the second phase. To formalize this two-phase investment setting, we propose an extension of Friedkin-Johnsen model, and hence formulate the utility functions of the camps. There is a tradeoff while splitting the budget between the two phases. A lower investment in the first phase results in worse initial biases for the second phase, while a higher investment spares a lower available budget for the second phase. We first analyze the non-competitive case where only one camp invests, for which we present a polynomial time algorithm for determining an optimal way to split the camp's budget between the two phases. We then analyze the case of competing camps, where we show the existence of Nash equilibrium and that it can be computed in polynomial time under reasonable assumptions. We conclude our study with simulations on real-world network datasets, in order to quantify the effects of the initial biases and the weightage attributed by nodes to their initial biases, as well as that of a camp deviating from its equilibrium strategy. Our main conclusion is that, if nodes attribute high weightage to their initial biases, it is advantageous to have a high investment in the first phase, so as to effectively influence the biases to be harnessed in the second phase.

The power of neural ranking models lies in the ability to learn from the raw text inputs for the ranking problem to avoid many limitations of hand-crafted features. Neural networks have sufficient capacity to model complicated tasks, which is needed to handle the complexity of relevance estimation in ranking.

Setting: Academic institution. Design: Prospective case series. Methods: 74 subjects aged from 20 to 84 years and with no previous ocular surgeries were included in this study. The left eye was measured four times with a corneo scleral topographer (Eye Surface Profiler). From the raw anterior eye height data of each measurement, topographical limbus was demarcated and fitted in three dimensions to a circle, an ellipse and a Fourier series. Root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit. In addition, white to white (WTW) corneal diameter was taken from the readings of the measuring device and compared with the topographical limbus. For statistical analysis, subjects were grouped as young and older, and also according their equivalent sphere correction. Results: From the considered models, second order Fourier series resulted in the most accurate model to describe the shape of the human limbus. The difference between the topographical limbus diameter and the WTW corneal diameter amounted on average and standard deviation to 0.33 mm and 0.24 mm. Statistically significant differences among eye quadrants were found. No statistically significant difference in horizontal and vertical meridian between age groups (P=0.71 and P=0.082, respectively) or between myopes and emmetropes (P=0.78 and P=0.68, respectively) were found. Conclusions: Human limbus is not symmetrical and its shape is subject dependent but not related to age and eye refractive power.

This paper revisits drift analysis for the (1+1) EA on OneMax and obtains that the expected running time $E(T)$, starting from $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ one-bits, is determined by the sum of inverse drifts up to logarithmic error terms, more precisely $$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}\\frac{1}{\\Delta(k)} - c_1\\log n \\le E(T) \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}\\frac{1}{\\Delta(k)} - c_2\\log n,$$ where $\\Delta(k)$ is the drift (expected increase of the number of one-bits from the state of $n-k$ ones) and $c_1,c_2 >0$ are explicitly computed constants.

Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful tools to extract task-relevant information from a wide variety of EM measurements, ranging from optics to the microwave domain. However, given the ability to actively illuminate a particular scene with a programmable EM wavefront, it is often not clear what wavefronts optimally encode information for the task at hand (e.g., object detection, classification). Here, we show that by integrating a physical model of scene illumination and detection into a ML pipeline, we can jointly learn optimal sampling and measurement processing strategies for a given task. We consider in simulation the example of classifying objects using microwave radiation produced by dynamic metasurfaces. By integrating an analytical forward model describing the metamaterial elements as coupled dipoles into the ML pipeline, we jointly train analog model weights with digital neural network weights. The learned non-intuitive illumination settings yield a higher classification accuracy using fewer measurements. On the practical level, these results are highly relevant to emerging context-aware systems such as autonomous vehicles, touchless human-interactive devices or within smart health care, where strict time constraints place severe limits on measurement strategies.

Nonetheless, the intertwining between electronic correlation and lattice effects has precluded a comprehensive description of the rutile metal to monoclinic insulator transition, in turn triggering a longstanding \"the chicken or the egg\" debate about which comes first, the Mott localisation or the Peierls distortion. Here, we show that this problem is in fact ill-posed: the electronic correlations and the lattice vibrations conspire to stabilise the monoclinic insulator, and so they must be treated on equal footing not to miss relevant pieces of the VO$_2$ physics. Specifically, we design a minimal model for VO$_2$ that includes all the important physical ingredients: the electronic correlations, the multi-orbital character, and the two components antiferrodistortive mode that condenses in the monoclinic insulator. We solve this model by dynamical mean-field theory within the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Consistently with the first-order character of the metal-insulator transition, the Born-Oppenheimer potential has a rich landscape, with minima corresponding to the undistorted phase and to the four equivalent distorted ones, and which translates into an equally rich thermodynamics that we uncover by the Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we find that a distorted metal phase intrudes between the low-temperature distorted insulator and high-temperature undistorted metal, which sheds new light on the debated experimental evidence of a monoclinic metallic phase.

Emission line ratios and widths are employed to identify the dominant ionization mechanisms for the host and outflow components in each object.

In three cases, the outflowing gas is more highly ionized than the gas in the host, indicating that it is more strongly exposed to the ionizing radiation field of the AGN. In two objects, a positive correlation between the line widths and line ratios in the outflowing gas component indicates that shocks with velocities of order 100 $-$ 500 km s$^{-1}$ may also be contributing to the ionization and heating of the outflowing gas component. The line ratios in the outflowing gas of one of these two objects also suggest a significant contribution from photoionization by hot, young stars in the portion of the outflow that is closest to star-forming regions in the host galaxy component. The data thus favor photoionization by hot stars in the host galaxy rather than stars formed in the outflow itself.

Although Laves phases have been proven to be stable in a binary hard-sphere system, they have never been observed to spontaneously crystallize in such a fluid mixture in simulations nor in experiments of micron-sized hard spheres due to slow dynamics. Here we demonstrate, using computer simulations, that softness in the interparticle potential suppresses the degree of fivefold symmetry in the binary fluid phase and enhances crystallization of Laves phases in nearly hard spheres.

Our exploration could provide guidance for selecting proper BPE configurations in the future. Most prominently: we show that for LSTM-based architectures, it is necessary to experiment with a wide range of different BPE operations as there is no typical optimal BPE configuration, whereas for Transformer architectures, smaller BPE size tends to be a typically optimal choice. We urge the community to make prudent choices with subword merge operations, as our experiments indicate that a sub-optimal BPE configuration alone could easily reduce the system performance by 3-4 BLEU points.

A well-understood selection function allows us to constrain p(q) in 35 independent bins of primary mass and separation, with hundreds to thousands of binaries in each bin. Our investigation reveals a sharp excess of equal-mass ``twin'' binaries that is statistically significant out to separations of 1,000 to 10,000 AU, depending on primary mass. The excess is narrow: a steep increase in p(q) at $0.95 \\lesssim q < 1$, with no significant excess at $q\\lesssim 0.95$. A range of tests confirm that the signal is real, not a data artifact or selection effect. Combining the Gaia wide binary constraints with those from close binaries, we show that the twin excess decreases with increasing separation, but its width ($q\\gtrsim 0.95$) is constant over $0.01 < a/{\\rm AU} < 10,000$. The wide twin population would be difficult to explain if the components of all wide binaries formed via core fragmentation, which is not expected to produce strongly correlated component masses. We conjecture that twin wide binaries formed at closer separations (a < 100 AU), likely via accretion from circumbinary disks, and were subsequently widened by dynamical interactions in their birth environments. The separation-dependence of the twin excess then constrains the efficiency of dynamical widening and disruption of binaries in young clusters. We also constrain p(q) across $0.1 \\lesssim q < 1$. Besides changes in the twin fraction, p(q) is independent of separation at fixed primary mass over 100 < s/AU < 50,000. It is flatter than expected for random pairings from the IMF but more bottom-heavy for wide binaries than for binaries with a < 100 AU.

In [E.A.

However, an issue can be raised against the model: while the factorization method of the time evolution operator used there is formally correct, it is not completely rigorous due to some unstated conditions on the validity of the factorization in the Hilbert space of the model. Furthermore, no examples were presented there in implementing the measurement scheme in specific quantum systems. The goal of this paper is to re-examine the model and confirm its features independently by solving the von Neumann equation for the joint state of the composite system as a function of time. This approach reproduces the joint state obtained in the original work, leading to the same conditions for exact decoherence and orthogonal pointer states when the required initial conditions on the probe and pointer are imposed.

When the domain of the problem is large (e.g. traversal of a high-dimensional space), a perfect solution cannot be obtained, so approximations must be made. These approximations often lead to a reported quantity of interest (QOI) which varies between runs, decreasing the confidence of any single run. When the algorithm further computes this final QOI based on uncertain or noisy data, the variability (or lack of confidence) of the final QOI increases. Unbounded, these two sources of uncertainty (algorithmic approximations and uncertainty in input data) can result in a reported statistic that has low correlation with ground truth.   In biological applications, this is especially applicable, as the search space is generally approximated at least to some degree (e.g. a high percentage of protein structures are invalid or energetically unfavorable) and the explicit conversion from continuous to discrete space for protein representation implies some uncertainty in the input data. This research applies uncertainty quantification techniques to the difficult protein-protein docking problem, first showing the variability that exists in existing software, and then providing a method for computing probabilistic certificates in the form of Chernoff-like bounds. Finally, this paper leverages these probabilistic certificates to accurately bound the uncertainty in docking from two docking algorithms, providing a QOI that is both robust and statistically meaningful.

Disentangled linguistic and speaker representations are learned in proposed method. Our model is built under the framework of encoder-decoder. Encoders are used to extract hidden representations, which the decoder uses for recovering acoustic features. For learning disentangled linguistic representations, we proposed two strategies. First, additional text inputs are introduced for generating embeddings with audio inputs jointly. And hidden embeddings of text inputs are used as the reference for those of audio inputs. Second, an adversarial training method is adopted to further wipe out speaker related descriptions from the linguistic embeddings of audio signals. Meanwhile, speaker representations are extracted by a speaker encoder. Both the encoder for extracting linguistic representations from audio and the decoder themselves are built with seq2seq network. Therefore there is no constrain of the frame-by-frame conversion in our proposed method. For training the model, a strategy that consists of two stages is adopted. At the first stage, our model is pre-trained on a multi-speaker dataset. Then it is finetuned on the dataset of a specific conversion pair at the second stage. Experiments were conducted to compare the proposed method with both parallel and non-parallel baselines. The experimental results showed that our method obtained higher similarity and naturalness compared to the top rank method in Voice Conversion Challenge 2018, which is a non-parallel baseline. And the performance of proposed method was closed to the state-of-art seq2seq based parallel baseline.

For the constant magnetic flux scenario, the system can be solved analytically and exact solutions are found. For the constant magnetic field scenario, with the short wormhole approximation, the quantized energies and eigenstates are obtained. The system exhibits both the spin-orbit coupling and the Landau quantization for the stationary states in both scenarios. The intrinsic curvature of the surface induces the spin-orbit and spin-magnetic Landau couplings that generate imaginary energy. Imaginary energy can be interpreted as the energy dissipation and instability of the states.

For each country, we periodically examined its 500 most popular websites - 6,579 in total - for the presence of and updates to their privacy policy. While many websites already had privacy policies, we find that in some countries up to 15.7 % of websites added new privacy policies by May 25, 2018, resulting in 84.5 % of websites having privacy policies. 72.6 % of websites with existing privacy policies updated them close to the date. Most visibly, 62.1 % of websites in Europe now display cookie consent notices, 16 % more than in January 2018. These notices inform users about a site's cookie use and user tracking practices.

We describe their use in other fields, show how they are related and can be combined, and expand on their possible generalisations. Wherever Monte Carlo gradient estimators have been derived and deployed in the past, important advances have followed.

The pivotal role is thereby ascribable to the optimization of the molecular orbital parameters of a complete active space wave function in the presence of a Jastrow correlation function. Excellent results are obtained for ZnO, FeO, FeH, and CrS. In addition, potential energy curves are computed for the first three compounds at multi-reference diffusion Monte Carlo (MR-DMC) level, from which spectroscopic constants such as the equilibrium bond distance, the harmonic frequency, and the anharmonicity are extracted.

Furthermore, it is shown for CrS that a restricted active space calculation can yield improved initial orbitals by including single and double excitations from the original active space into a set of virtual orbitals. We showed in this study that the MR-DMC method is able to outperform established high-level quantum chemistry methods, such as coupled cluster and CASPT2.

While DMC calculations with a large number of determinants are possible and very accurate, our results demonstrate that compact wave functions may be sufficient in order to obtain accurate nodal surfaces, which determine the accuracy of DMC, even in the case of transition metal compounds.

We use a well-defined sample of morphologically non-disturbed 109 SNe Ia host ellipticals from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galactocentric distributions of normal and 91bg-like SNe are consistent with each other, and with the radial light distribution of host stellar populations, when excluding bias against central SNe. Among the global parameters, only the distributions of u-r colours and ages are inconsistent significantly between the ellipticals of different SN Ia subclasses: the hosts of normal SNe are on average bluer and younger than those of 91bg-like SNe. In the colour-mass diagram, the tail of colour distribution of normal SN hosts stretches into the Green Valley - transitional state of galaxy evolution, while the same tail of 91bg-like SN hosts barely reaches that region. Therefore, the bluer and younger ellipticals might have more residual star formation that gives rise to younger \"prompt\" progenitors, resulting in normal SNe Ia with shorter delay times. These ellipticals can also produce \"delayed\" 91bg-like events with lower rate, because of long delay times of these SNe. The redder and older ellipticals that already exhausted their gas for star formation may produce significantly less normal SNe Ia with shorter delay times, outnumbered by 91bg-like SNe with long delay times. Our results favor SN Ia progenitor models such as He-ignited violent mergers as a unified model for normal and 91bg-like SNe that have the potential to explain their observed properties.

While associated BCJ numerators are known on closed forms to any multiplicity at tree level, the kinematic algebra has only been partially explored for the simplest of four-dimensional amplitudes: up to the MHV sector. In this paper we introduce a framework that allows us to characterize the algebra beyond the MHV sector. This allows us to both constrain some of the ambiguities of the kinematic algebra, and better control the generalized gauge freedom that is associated with the BCJ numerators. Specifically, in this paper, we work in dimension-agnostic notation and determine the kinematic algebra valid up to certain ${\\cal O}\\big((\\varepsilon_i \\cdot \\varepsilon_j)^2\\big)$ terms that in four dimensions compute the next-to-MHV sector involving two scalars. The kinematic algebra in this sector is simple, given that we introduce tensor currents that generalize standard Yang-Mills vector currents. These tensor currents controls the generalized gauge freedom, allowing us to generate multiple different versions of BCJ numerators from the same kinematic algebra. The framework should generalize to other sectors in Yang-Mills theory.

A well-known conjecture of Hartsfield and Ringel (1994) is that every connected graph other than $K_2$ admits an antimagic labelling. In 2017, two sets of authors (Arumugam, Premalatha, Ba\\v{c}a \\& Semani\\v{c}ov\\'{a}-Fe\\v{n}ov\\v{c}\\'{i}kov\\'{a} and Bensmail, Senhaji \\& Szabo Lyngsie) independently introduced the weaker notion of a local antimagic labelling, where only adjacent vertices must be distinguished. Both sets of authors conjectured that any connected graph other than $K_2$ admits a local antimagic labelling. Recently, Haslegrave (2018) proved that every graph without isolated edges admits a local antimagic labeling. A graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be local antimagic total if there exists a bijection $f: V\\cup E \\to\\{1,2,\\ldots ,|V\\cup E|\\}$ such that for any pair of adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, $w(u)\\not= w(v)$, where the induced vertex weight $w(u)= f(u) +\\sum f(e)$, with $e$ ranging over all the edges incident to $u$. The local antimagic total chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\\chi_{lat}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct induced vertex weights over all local antimagic total labelings of $G$. In this note, we proved that every graph admits a local antimagic total labeling. We then determine the exact value of $\\chi_{lat}(G)$ for some standard graphs $G$.

However, unlike classical Hamming metric or even rank-metric, there are still many unsolved problems on list decoding of insdel codes.   The purpose of the current paper is to move toward complete or partial solutions for some of these problems. Our contributions mainly consist of three parts. Firstly, we provide an upper bound on the list decoding radius of an insdel code in terms of its rate. This bound provides some improvements when degenerated to insertions only and deletions only compared to the previous results in [17]. Secondly, we analyse the list decodability of random insdel codes. It shows that although there is a gap between the list decoding radius of random insdel codes and our upper bound on list decoding radius, when the alphabet size is sufficiently large, this gap no longer exists. In addition, we show that list decoding of random insdel codes surpasses the Singleton bound when there are more insertion errors than deletion errors and the alphabet size is sufficiently large. We also find that our results improve some previous findings in [17] and [12]. Furthermore, our results reveal the existence of an insdel code that can be list decoded against insdel errors beyond its minimum insdel distance while still having polynomial list size. Lastly, we construct a family of explicit insdel codes with efficient list decoding algorithm. As a result, we obtain a Zyablov-type bound for insdel errors.

The parameters of a constitutive model are usually identified by minimization of the difference between model response and experimental data. However, measurement errors and differences in the specimens lead to deviations in the determined parameters. In this article, the Choboche model is used and a stochastic simulation technique is applied to generate artificial data which exhibit the same stochastic behavior as experimental data. Then the model parameters are identified by applying an estimation using Bayes's theorem. The Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (TMCMC) is introduced and employed to estimate the model parameters in the Bayesian setting. The uniform distributions of the parameters representing their priors are considered which literally means no knowledge of the parameters is available. Identified parameters are compared with the true parameters in the simulation, and the efficiency of the identification method is discussed. In fact, the main purpose of this study is to observe the possibility of identifying the model and hardening parameters of a viscoplastic model as a very high non-linear model with only a surface displacement measurement vector in the Bayesian setting using TMCMC and evaluate the number of measurements needed for a very acceptable estimation of the uncertain parameters of the model.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in two frequency bands (C-band, L-band), we analyzed the radio properties, including polarization and the transport processes of the CR electrons (CREs), in the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4013. Supplementary LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) data at 150MHz are used to study the low-frequency properties of this galaxy and X-ray (Chandra, XMM-Newton) data are used to investigate the central region. The central point source dominates the radio continuum in both CHANG-ES bands, but no clear AGN classification is possible at this time. The scale height analysis shows that Gaussian fits, with halo scale heights of 1.2 kpc in C-band, 2.0 kpc in L-band, and 3.1 kpc at 150 MHz, better represent the intensity profiles than do exponential fits. The radio continuum halo of NGC 4013 in C-band is rather small, while the low-frequency LOFAR data reveal a large halo. The polarization data reveal plane-parallel, regular magnetic fields within the entire disk and vertical halo components out to heights of about 6 kpc indicating the presence of an axisymmetric field having a radial component pointing outwards. The mean magnetic field strength of the disk of NGC 4013 of 6.6 $\\mu$G (using the revised equipartition formula) is rather small. The interaction and the low star formation rate (SFR) across the disk of NGC 4013 probably influence the appearance of its radio continuum. Several observable quantities give consistent evidence that the CR transport in the halo of NGC 4013 is diffusive: the frequency dependence of the synchrotron scale height, the disk/halo flux density ratio, the vertical profile of the synchrotron spectral index, the small propagation speed measured modeled with spinnaker, and the low temperature of the X-ray emitting hot gas.

This new price development has received a lot of attention in political discussions in which it has been attributed to the recent reform of the EU ETS -- the strengthening of the Market Stability Reserve through cancellation. It is, however, challenging to find empirical evidence which can link the two, or more generally, to provide evidence about the true cause of the upward trend. In this paper, we obtain first empirical results pointing in the direction of a period of exuberance in EUA prices. This period overlaps with the recent upward trend in prices. We further investigate several abatement-related fundamentals and show that they do not display explosive behavior which could have driven the allowance price movements. We conjecture that this price exuberance could either be caused by an adaption process or an overreaction of prices to the announcement of the reform.

LIME typically generates an explanation for a single prediction by any ML model by learning a simpler interpretable model (e.g. linear classifier) around the prediction through generating simulated data around the instance by random perturbation, and obtaining feature importance through applying some form of feature selection. While LIME and similar local algorithms have gained popularity due to their simplicity, the random perturbation and feature selection methods result in \"instability\" in the generated explanations, where for the same prediction, different explanations can be generated. This is a critical issue that can prevent deployment of LIME in a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, where stability is of utmost importance to earn the trust of medical professionals. In this paper, we propose a deterministic version of LIME.

The automatic segmentation is however still challenging, due to the heterogeneous intensity distributions and indistinct boundaries in the images. In this paper, we propose a new method, based on deep neural networks (DNN), for fully automatic segmentation. The proposed network, referred to as SRSCN, comprises a shape reconstruction neural network (SRNN) and a spatial constraint network (SCN). SRNN aims to maintain a realistic shape of the resulting segmentation. It can be pre-trained by a set of label images, and then be embedded into a unified loss function as a regularization term. Hence, no manually designed feature is needed. Furthermore, SCN incorporates the spatial information of the 2D slices. It is formulated and trained with the segmentation network via the multi-task learning strategy. We evaluated the proposed method using 45 patients and compared with two state-of-the-art regularization schemes, i.e., the anatomically constraint neural network and the adversarial neural network. The results show that the proposed SRSCN outperformed the conventional schemes, and obtained a Dice score of 0.758(std=0.227) for myocardial segmentation, which compares with 0.757(std=0.083) from the inter-observer variations.

In this work, we introduce unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, which translates a language to a distant language through multiple hops, and the unsupervised translation on each hop is relatively easier than the original direct translation. We propose a learning to route (LTR) method to choose the translation path between the source and target languages. LTR is trained on language pairs whose best translation path is available and is applied on the unseen language pairs for path selection. Experiments on 20 languages and 294 distant language pairs demonstrate the advantages of the unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed LTR for path selection. Specifically, in the best case, LTR achieves an improvement of 5.58 BLEU points over the conventional direct unsupervised method.

HIVE-COTE recognizes that time series are a specific data type for which the traditional attribute-value representation, used predominantly in machine learning, fails to provide a relevant representation. HIVE-COTE combines multiple types of classifiers: each extracting information about a specific aspect of a time series, be it in the time domain, frequency domain or summarization of intervals within the series. However, HIVE-COTE (and its predecessor, FLAT-COTE) is often infeasible to run on even modest amounts of data. For instance, training HIVE-COTE on a dataset with only 1,500 time series can require 8 days of CPU time. It has polynomial runtime w.r.t training set size, so this problem compounds as data quantity increases. We propose a novel TSC algorithm, TS-CHIEF, which is highly competitive to HIVE-COTE in accuracy, but requires only a fraction of the runtime. TS-CHIEF constructs an ensemble classifier that integrates the most effective embeddings of time series that research has developed in the last decade. It uses tree-structured classifiers to do so efficiently. We assess TS-CHIEF on 85 datasets of the UCR archive, where it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with scalability and efficiency. We demonstrate that TS-CHIEF can be trained on 130k time series in 2 days, a data quantity that is beyond the reach of any TSC algorithm with comparable accuracy.

This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets.

We propose RUBi, a new learning strategy to reduce biases in any VQA model. It reduces the importance of the most biased examples, i.e. examples that can be correctly classified without looking at the image. It implicitly forces the VQA model to use the two input modalities instead of relying on statistical regularities between the question and the answer. We leverage a question-only model that captures the language biases by identifying when these unwanted regularities are used. It prevents the base VQA model from learning them by influencing its predictions. This leads to dynamically adjusting the loss in order to compensate for biases. We validate our contributions by surpassing the current state-of-the-art results on VQA-CP v2.

These changes in the mode frequencies could modify the small separation of low-degree modes (i.e. frequency difference between consecutive quadrupole and radial modes), which is sensitive to the core structure and hence to the evolutionary stage of the star. Determining global stellar parameters such as the age using mode frequencies at a given moment of the magnetic activity cycle could lead to biased results.

We used data from 28 adults exposed to sulfuric acid for 4 hours in a controlled exposure chamber over a 3 day period with repeated measures of pulmonary function (FEV1) recorded at 2-hour intervals. Measurements were also recorded after 2 and 24 hours post exposure. We formulated a linear mixed effect model for FEV1 with fixed effects (day of treatment, hour, day-hour interaction, and smoking status), a random intercept and an AR1 covariance structure to estimate the effect of aerosol exposure on FEV1. We further assessed whether smoking status modified the exposure effects and compared the analysis to the method used by Kerr et al.,1981. The findings of the study show that the effect of day 3 exposure is negatively associated with lung function (coefficient ($\\beta$), -0.08; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.01). A weak negative association is also observed with increasing hours of exposure ($\\beta$, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.00).

In the case of AFC trained with Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than the training of the Artificial Neural Network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches. The first one, which is well documented in the literature, consists in the parallelization of the numerical simulation itself. The second one consists in parallelizing the DRL algorithm, by using several independent simulations running in parallel to provide data to the Artificial Neural Network. In the present work, we discuss this second solution for parallelization. We show that the problem is embarrassingly parallel and that perfect speedup can be obtained up to the batch size of the problem, with weaker scaling still taking place for a larger number of simulations.

The proposed divide-and-conquer approach leverages recent advances in compressed sensing and forward error correction to produce a novel uncoordinated access paradigm, along with a computationally efficient decoding algorithm. Within this framework, every active device partitions its data into several sub-blocks and, subsequently, adds redundancy using a systematic linear block code. Compressed sensing techniques are then employed to recover sub-blocks up to a permutation of their order, and the original messages are obtained by stitching fragments together using a tree-based algorithm. The error probability and computational complexity of this access paradigm are characterized. An optimization framework, which exploits the tradeoff between performance and computational complexity, is developed to assign parity-check bits to each sub-block. In addition, two emblematic parity bit allocation strategies are examined and their performances are analyzed in the limit as the number of active users and their corresponding payloads tend to infinity.

We start with a set of manual annotations of draft time-aligned lyrics and notes made by non-expert users of Karaoke games. This set comes without audio.

Each candidate is then turned into a singing-voice probability over time using a teacher, a deep convolutional neural network singing-voice detection system (SVD), trained on cleaned data. Comparing the time-aligned lyrics and the singing-voice probability, we detect matches and update the time-alignment lyrics accordingly. From this, we obtain new audio sets.

Specifically, we consider abstracting feedforward neural networks with Bernstein polynomials for a small subset of inputs. To quantify the error introduced by abstraction, we provide both theoretical error bound estimation based on the theory of Bernstein polynomials and more practical sampling based error bound estimation, following a tight Lipschitz constant estimation approach based on forward reachability analysis.

Every source message must be recovered perfectly at the destination subject to a fixed decoding delay of $T$ time slots. In any sliding window of $T+1$ time slots, we assume no more than $N_1$ and $N_2$ erasures are introduced by the first-hop channel and second-hop channel respectively. Under this channel loss assumption, we fully characterize the maximum achievable rate in terms of $T$, $N_1$ and $N_2$. The achievability is proved by using a symbol-wise decode-forward strategy where the source symbols within the same message are decoded by the relay with different delays. The converse is proved by analyzing the maximum achievable rate for each channel when the erasures in the other channel are consecutive (bursty). In addition, we show that traditional message-wise decode-forward strategies, which require the source symbols within the same message to be decoded by the relay with the same delay, are sub-optimal in general.

We briefly discuss the emerging mass-metallicity relation, the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, and an extension of the model that includes feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). These self-regulation results are independent of the star formation law and the galaxy's gas content.

The full benefits of extrapolation-based methods are not known: i) there is no unified analysis for a large class of games that includes both strongly monotone and bilinear games; ii) it is not known whether the rate achieved by extragradient can be improved, e.g. by considering multiple extrapolation steps. We answer these questions through new analysis of the extragradient's local and global convergence properties. Our analysis covers the whole range of settings between purely bilinear and strongly monotone games. It reveals that extragradient converges via different mechanisms at these extremes; in between, it exploits the most favorable mechanism for the given problem.

Our bounds prove that the extragradient achieves the optimal rate in this class, and that our upper bounds are tight.

The channel states are modeled by stochastic processes with joint distributions known to users. However, the exact state of a channel at any time is not observable. We first consider two channel models: (i) the fast time-varying channel model (where the channel states are assumed to be independent and identically distributed in each time slot), and (ii) the slow time-varying channel model (where the channel states remain unchanged over time). Among the classes of the blind rendezvous policies that randomly hop on channels according to certain channel selection probabilities, we show the optimal channel selection policy that minimizes the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) is the single selection policy that hops on the ``best'' channel all the time in the fast time-varying channel model. However, for the slow time-varying channel model, it is much more difficult to find the optimal channel selection policy. By using the majorization ordering, we derive a lower bound and an upper bound for the ETTR under the assumption that the channel states are exchangeable random variables. Bases on these bounds, we then prove various approximation solutions.

Such gamma-ray bursts have only been observed accompanying Type Ibc supernovae, indicating a stellar progenitor that lost its Hydrogen envelope before collapse. It is possible that jets are launched in core-collapse events even in the presence of a Hydrogen envelope, however, such jets are unlikely to be able to burrow through the star and will be stalled before escaping. High-energy neutrinos produced by such choked jets could escape the stellar envelope and could be observed.

One factor which governs the behaviour of a material, under a given condition, is the microstructure. Despite the absence of any phase transformation, a change in the microstructure would significantly alter the properties. Therefore, a substantial understanding on the stability of the microstructure is vital to avert any unexpected catastrophic change in the material properties. In the present work, one such numerical approach called phase-field modelling in employed to analyse the stability of two- and three-dimensional finite structures, which dictate the curvature-driven evolution of the microstructure. A characteristic feature of this numerical approach is the introduction of a scalar variable, called the phase field, in addition to the other thermodynamic variables. While the inclusion of the phase field obviates the need for the interface tracking, which is a strenuous aspect of the other conventional techniques, it replaces the sharp interface with a finite diffuse region. Therefore, before adopting and extending the phase-field technique, it is shown that the model recovers the governing law, i.e, Gibbs-Thomson relation, despite the introduction of the diffuse interface. Subsequently, the numerical treatment is employed to investigate the volume-diffusion governed curvature-induced transformation.

This fact puts severe constraints on many potential low-energy extensions of the Higgs sector of the SM. In the well-known Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), an `alignment limit' of parameters readily furnishes one SM-like scalar, and can be achieved naturally through an underlying symmetry. Among the other physical states of the 2HDM, a charged scalar $H^\\pm$ would provide striking evidence of new physics if observed. We propose a novel technique for the observation of the process $pp\\to t b H^\\pm \\to t\\bar{t}b\\bar{b}$ in the dileptonic decay channel at the LHC. The reconstruction of events in this channel is complicated by multiple $b$-jets and unobserved neutrinos in the final state. To determine the neutrino momenta, we implement a neutrino weighting procedure to study, for the first time, the $t\\bar{t}b\\bar{b}$ signature. We further train a pair of boosted decision trees to reconstruct and classify signal events. We determine the resulting reach within the context of naturally aligned 2HDMs, such as the Maximally Symmetric Two Higgs Doublet Model (MS-2HDM). By testing at the integrated luminosity of 150 fb$^{-1}$ achieved in Run 2 of the LHC, we find that this channel may restrict the parameter space of a Type-II MS-2HDM with charged Higgs masses as high as 680 GeV.

Medical image reconstruction is one of the most fundamental and important components of medical imaging, whose major objective is to acquire high-quality medical images for clinical usage at the minimal cost and risk to the patients. Mathematical models in medical image reconstruction or, more generally, image restoration in computer vision, have been playing a prominent role. Earlier mathematical models are mostly designed by human knowledge or hypothesis on the image to be reconstructed, and we shall call these models handcrafted models. Later, handcrafted plus data-driven modeling started to emerge which still mostly relies on human designs, while part of the model is learned from the observed data. More recently, as more data and computation resources are made available, deep learning based models (or deep models) pushed the data-driven modeling to the extreme where the models are mostly based on learning with minimal human designs. Both handcrafted and data-driven modeling have their own advantages and disadvantages. One of the major research trends in medical imaging is to combine handcrafted modeling with deep modeling so that we can enjoy benefits from both approaches. The major part of this article is to provide a conceptual review of some recent works on deep modeling from the unrolling dynamics viewpoint. This viewpoint stimulates new designs of neural network architectures with inspirations from optimization algorithms and numerical differential equations. Given the popularity of deep modeling, there are still vast remaining challenges in the field, as well as opportunities which we shall discuss at the end of this article.

Bade (2019) presented the Crawler, an alternative procedure enjoying the same properties (with the additional advantage of being implementable in obviously dominant strategies); while Damamme et al. (2015) showed that allowing mutually beneficial swap-deals among the agents was already enough to guarantee Pareto-optimality. In this paper we significantly deepen our understanding of this decentralized procedures: we show in particular that the single-peaked domains happen to be ``maximal'' if one wishes to guarantee this convergence property. Interestingly, we also observe that the set of allocations reachable by swap-deals always contains the outcome of the Crawler. To further investigate how these different mechanisms compare, we pay special attention to the average and minimum rank of the resource obtained by the agents in the outcome allocation. We provide theoretical bounds on the loss potentially induced by these procedures with respect to these criteria, and complement these results with an extensive experimental study which shows how different variants of swap dynamics behave. In fact, even the simplest dynamics exhibit very good results, and it is possible to further guide the process towards our objectives, if one is ready to sacrifice a bit in terms of decentralization.

However, coronal magnetic field measurements remain an outstanding challenge. Computational models of coronal magnetic fields serve an important purpose in this context. Earlier work has demonstrated that the large-scale coronal field is governed by slow surface flux evolution and memory build-up which allows for prediction of the coronal structure on solar rotational timescales.

The perturbations are represented as independent, bounded, zero-mean random variables, and the probabilistic perturbation bound is based on Azuma's inequality.

For the latter, we construct a Martingale that mirrors the sequential order of computations.   Numerical experiments confirm that our bounds are more informative, often by several orders of magnitude, than traditional deterministic bounds -- even for small vector dimensions~$n$ and very stringent success probabilities.

We investigate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction, between two magnetic impurity moments in armchair-terminated B$_2$S nanoribbons in the presence of strain and staggered sublattice potential. By using an accurate tight-binding model, we firstly study the electronic properties of all infinite-length armchair B$_2$S nanoribbons (ABSNRs), with different edges, in the presence of both strain and staggered potential. The ABSNRs show different electronic and magnetic behaviors due to different edge morphologies. The band gap energy of ABSNRs depends strongly upon the applied staggered potential and thus one can engineer the electronic properties of the ABSNRs via tuning the external staggered potential. A complete and fully reversible semiconductor (or insulator) to metal transition has been observed via tuning the external staggered potential, which can be easily realized experimentally. A prominent feature is the presence of a quasiflat edge mode, isolated from the bulk modes in the ABSNRs belong to the family $M=6p$, with $M$ the width of the ABSNR and $p$ an integer number. The position of the quasi-flatbands(QFBs) in the energy diagram of ABSNRs can be shifted by applying the in-plane strains. At a critical staggered potential, for nanoribbons of arbitrary width, the QFB changes to a perfect flatband. The RKKY interaction has an oscillating behaviour in terms of the applied staggered potentials and width of the ribbon, such that for two magnetic adatoms randomly distributed on the surface of an ABSNR the staggered potential can reverse the RKKY from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism and vice versa.

Moreover we test the super-resolved bands from an application point of view by monitoring active fire through classic indices.

Consequently, Trotter-Suzuki is only practical for sparse Hamiltonians. Trotter-Suzuki is a deterministic compiler but it was recently shown that randomised compiling offers lower overheads.

For high dimensional temporal-spatial models, classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often slow to converge, and it is necessary to apply Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) sampling on parameter blocks. However, the computation cost of each MwG iteration is typically $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the model dimension. This can be too expensive in practice. This paper introduces a new reduced computation method to bring down the computation cost to $O(n)$, for the inverse initial value problem of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with local interactions. The key observation is that each MwG proposal is only different from the original iterate at one parameter block, and this difference will only propagate within a local domain in the SDE computations. Therefore we can approximate the global SDE computation with a surrogate updated only within the local domain for reduced computation cost. Both theoretically and numerically, we show that the approximation errors can be controlled by the local domain size. We discuss how to implement the local computation scheme using Euler-Maruyama and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods. We numerically demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with the Lorenz 96 model and a linear stochastic flow model.

We first construct an analytical model of stellar encounters. We find that individual perturbations do not modify the dynamics of the comets in the cloud unless very close (< 0.5pc) encounters occur. Using proper motions, parallaxes, and radial velocities from Gaia DR2, we construct an astrometric catalogue of 14,659 stars that are within 50pc from the Sun.

However, applying ML to problems in the physical sciences comes with a unique set of challenges: scientists want physically interpretable models that can (i) generalize to predict previously unobserved behaviors, (ii) provide effective forecasting predictions (extrapolation), and (iii) be certifiable. Autonomous systems will necessarily interact with changing and uncertain environments, motivating the need for models that can accurately extrapolate based on physical principles (e.g. Newton's universal second law for classical mechanics, F=ma). Standard ML approaches have shown impressive performance for predicting dynamics in an interpolatory regime, but the resulting models often lack interpretability and fail to generalize.   In this paper, we introduce a unified sparse optimization framework that learns governing dynamical systems models from data, selecting relevant terms in the dynamics from a library of possible functions. The resulting models are parsimonious, have physical interpretations, and can generalize to new parameter regimes. Our framework allows the use of non-convex sparsity promoting regularization functions and can be adapted to address key challenges in scientific problems and data sets, including outliers, parametric dependencies, and physical constraints. We show that the approach discovers parsimonious dynamical models on several example systems, including a spiking neuron model. This flexible approach can be tailored to the unique challenges associated with a wide range of applications and data sets, providing a powerful ML-based framework for learning governing models for physical systems from data.

An operator observes a plant through an observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted by an attacker who can insert and erase some sensor readings. The operator observes the system evolution in order to validate if a state in a given set of unsafe states is reached. The attacker corrupts the observation with the aim of preventing the operator to verify when an interesting state has been reached. Furthermore, the attacker wants to remain stealthy, namely he wants the operator does not realize that someone is corrupting his observation. An automaton, called attack structure is proposed, which supports the attacker in defining an effective attack. In more detail, first, the unbounded attack structure is obtained by doing the concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. Then, the n-bounded attack structure, for a given integer value of n, is obtained by doing the concurrent composition of the unbounded attack structure and an n-bounded attack automaton. Finally, the n-bounded attack structure can be made supremal and stealthy by appropriately trimming the previous attack structure. A stealthy attacker can elaborate his strategy looking at the supremal stealthy attack substructure and may result in different degrees of effectiveness: strong, weak or vain. The proposed approach can be dually used to verify if such an attack could be effective for the given system, thus to establish if the system is safe under attack.

This paper establishes a principle to set the reference probability via a data-dependent kernel which has a well-defined kernel characteristic that linked directly to local density. A solution based on a recent data-dependent kernel called Isolation Kernel addresses the fundamental issue as well as its two ensuing issues. As a result, it significantly improves the quality of the final visualisation output and removes one obstacle that prevents t-SNE from processing large datasets. The solution is extremely simple, i.e., simply replacing the existing data independent kernel with Isolation Kernel, leaving the rest of the t-SNE procedure unchanged.

The ions are accelerated through an electric field, where they transfer their momentum to neutral air molecules through impacts, creating thrust.

Secondly, the invariant arguments of the universal scaling functions necessary to perform scaling collapses can be directly determined using our recent normal form theory of the Renormalization Group. This method has proven useful in cleanly capturing the complex behavior which occurs in both the lower and upper critical dimensions of systems and here captures the 2D NE-RFIM behavior well. The obtained scaling collapses span over a range of a factor of ten in the disorder and a factor of $10^4$ in avalanche cutoff. They are consistent with a critical disorder at zero and with a lower critical dimension for the model equal to two.

These rigid data retrieval mechanisms pose hurdles for non-expert users, who typically lack language expertise and are unfamiliar with the details of the schema. Query by Example (QBE) methods offer an alternative mechanism: users provide examples of their intended query output and the QBE system needs to infer the intended query. However, these approaches focus on the structural similarity of the examples and ignore the richer context present in the data. As a result, they typically produce queries that are too general, and fail to capture the user's intent effectively. In this paper, we present SQuID, a system that performs semantic similarity-aware query intent discovery. Our work makes the following contributions: (1) We design an end-to-end system that automatically formulates select-project-join queries in an open-world setting, with optional group-by aggregation and intersection operators; a much larger class than prior QBE techniques. (2) We express the problem of query intent discovery using a probabilistic abduction model, that infers a query as the most likely explanation of the provided examples. (3) We introduce the notion of an abduction-ready database, which precomputes semantic properties and related statistics, allowing SQuID to achieve real-time performance. (4) We present an extensive empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets, including user-intent case studies, demonstrating that SQuID is efficient and effective, and outperforms machine learning methods, as well as the state-of-the-art in the related query reverse engineering problem.

We gauge the complete consumption cycle of these policies, from the first user impressions until the compliance assessment. We create a diverse corpus of two sets of 6,278 unique English-language privacy policies from inside and outside the EU, covering their pre-GDPR and the post-GDPR versions. The results of our tests and analyses suggest that the GDPR has been a catalyst for a major overhaul of the privacy policies inside and outside the EU. This overhaul of the policies, manifesting in extensive textual changes, especially for the EU-based websites, comes at mixed benefits to the users. While the privacy policies have become considerably longer, our user study with 470 participants on Amazon MTurk indicates a significant improvement in the visual representation of privacy policies from the users' perspective for the EU websites. We further develop a new workflow for the automated assessment of requirements in privacy policies. Using this workflow, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices and are more consistent with seven compliance requirements post the GDPR. We also assess how transparent the organizations are with their privacy practices by performing specificity analysis. In this analysis, we find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the specificity level improving on average. Still, we find the landscape of privacy policies to be in a transitional phase; many policies still do not meet several key GDPR requirements or their improved coverage comes with reduced specificity.

From the measured data, we obtained the parameters of two path loss models, i.e., the close-in reference distance model (CIM) and the floating-intercept model (FIM). Results show that the path loss exponents estimated from the CIM are very close to that of the free-space path loss model, while the FIM provides a better fit to the measurement data.

The development is motivated by the fact that the accurate conservation of momentum is required for reliable numerical modelings of CCSN dynamics including a recoil of proto-neutron star (PNS). The new method is built on a hybrid approach, in which we use the energy-momentum tensor of neutrinos to compute the momentum feedback from neutrino to matter in the optically thick region while we employ the collision term in the optically thin region. In this method we utilize a general relativistic description of radiation-hydrodynamics with angular moments, which allows us to evaluate the momentum feedback from neutrino to matter without inconsistency with our Boltzmann solver. We demonstrate that the new method substantially improves the accuracy of linear momentum conservation in our CCSN simulations under reasonable angular resolutions in momentum space, alleviating the difficulty in giving the diffusion limit precisely with the discrete ordinate (Sn) method. It is the first-ever demonstration that the PNS kick can be handled directly and properly in multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the full Boltzmann neutrino transport.

As a proxy for effective dispersal, we performed a fine-scale investigation of the spatial genetic structure in males and females, using individuals originating from five sampling points located within 70 meters of each other. Based on microsatellite markers and spatial autocorrelation analyses, our results revealed that while males did not present a significant genetic structure at this geographic scale, females were significantly and genetically more similar to each other when they were collected in the same sampling point. As females invest more parental care than males in A. vulgare, but also because this species is promiscuous and males experience a high intrasexual competition, our results meet the predictions of most classical hypotheses for sex-biased dispersal.

First, for a class of problems with Lipschitz continuous gradients for all local functions, and for a class of undirected and unweighted graphs, we develop a lower bound analysis that identifies difficult problem instances for a class of properly defined distributed first-order methods.

To improve this situation, we propose a cross-lingual approach to sentiment analysis that is applicable to under-resourced languages and takes into account target-level information. This model incorporates sentiment information into bilingual distributional representations, by jointly optimizing them for semantics and sentiment, showing state-of-the-art performance at sentence-level when combined with machine translation. The adaptation to targeted sentiment analysis on multiple domains shows that our model outperforms other projection-based bilingual embedding methods on binary targeted sentiment tasks. Our analysis on ten languages demonstrates that the amount of unlabeled monolingual data has surprisingly little effect on the sentiment results. As expected, the choice of annotated source language for projection to a target leads to better results for source-target language pairs which are similar. Therefore, our results suggest that more efforts should be spent on the creation of resources for less similar languages to those which are resource-rich already. Finally, a domain mismatch leads to a decreased performance. This suggests resources in any language should ideally cover varieties of domains.

Quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols could provide unconditional security based on fundamental laws in physics. While the general security proof has been established recently in an entanglement-based QSS protocol, the tolerable channel loss is unfortunately rather small. Here we propose a continuous variable QSS protocol using conventional laser sources and homodyne detectors. In this protocol, a Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) prepared by one player passes through the secure stations of the other players sequentially, and each of the other players injects a locally prepared, independent GMCS into the circulating optical mode. Finally, the dealer measures both the amplitude and phase quadratures of the receiving optical mode using double homodyne detectors. Collectively, the players can use their encoded random numbers to estimate the measurement results of the dealer and further generate a shared key. Unlike the existing single photon based sequential QSS protocol, our scheme is intrinsically immune to Trojan horse attacks. Furthermore, the additional loss introduced by each player's system can be extremely small, which makes the protocol scalable to a large number of players. We prove the unconditional security of the proposed protocol against both eavesdroppers and dishonest players in the presence of high channel loss, and discuss various practical issues.

Our results help clarify the role non-separability can play in high-dimensional M-estimation.

The appeal of PQE is that many verification problems, e.g. equivalence checking and model checking, reduce to PQE and the latter is much easier to solve than complete QE. Earlier, we introduced a PQE algorithm based on the machinery of D-sequents. A D-sequent is a record stating that a clause is redundant in a quantified CNF formula in a specified subspace. To make this algorithm efficient, it is important to reuse learned D-sequents. However, reusing D-sequents is not as easy as conflict clauses in SAT-solvers because redundancy is a structural rather than a semantic property. (So, a clause is redundant only in some subset of logically equivalent CNF formulas.) We address this problem by introducing a modified definition of D-sequents that facilitates their safe reusing. We also present a new PQE algorithm that proves redundancy of target clauses one by one rather than all at once as in the previous PQE algorithm. We experimentally show the improved performance of this algorithm. We demonstrate that reusing D-sequents makes the new PQE algorithm even more powerful.

The probability distribution for the initial fluctuation is found quantum mechanically, while the subsequent nonlinear evolution is determined by classical dynamics. We find in a variety of cases that the rate of such flyover transitions has the same parametric form as that of tunneling transitions calculated using the instanton method, differing only by a numerical factor O(1) in the exponent. An important exception is an \"upward\" transition from a de Sitter vacuum to a higher-energy de Sitter vacuum state. The rate of flyover transitions in this case is parametrically different and can be many orders of magnitude higher than tunneling. This result is in conflict with the conventional picture of quantum de Sitter space as a thermal state. Our numerical simulations indicate that the dynamics of bubble nucleation in flyover transitions is rather different from the standard picture. The difference is especially strong for thin-wall bubbles in flat space, where the transition region oscillates between true and false vacuum until a true vacuum shell is formed which expands both inwards and outwards, and for upward de Sitter transitions, where the inflating new vacuum region is contained inside of a black hole.

Motivated by this correspondence, we propose that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the closed field line zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal slippage events dislocate field line foot points, initiating intense particle acceleration and pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission similar to that generated near pulsar polar caps. We argue that the energetics of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted for if the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is $\\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, values consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and radio-loud magnetars. Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere, so that the charge density in the closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field provoked by the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let $\\sim 1$ GHz radio emission escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs from known magnetars. The pair cascades crowd the closed flux tubes with plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting the radio pulse duration to $\\sim1$ ms.

We stratify the primitive spectrum $\\operatorname{Prim}(A)$ into symplectic cores, which should be thought of as families of non-commutative symplectic leaves.

Several application are given to Poisson representation theory. Our main tool is the Poisson enveloping algebra $A^e$ of a Poisson order $A$, which captures the Poisson representation theory of $A$. For $Z$ regular and affine we prove a PBW theorem for $A^e$ and use this to characterise the annihilators of simple Poisson modules: they coincide with the Poisson weakly locally closed, the Poisson primitive and the Poisson rational ideals.

Such variability is also a concern while optimizing the code more aggressively to gain performance. Efficient tools that help locate the program units (files and functions) within which most of the variability occurs are badly needed, both to plan for code ports and to root-cause errors due to variability when they happen in the field. In this work, we offer an enhanced version of the open-source testing framework FLiT to serve these roles. Key new features of FLiT include a suite of bisection algorithms that help locate the root causes of variability. Another added feature allows an analysis of the tradeoffs between performance and the degree of variability. Our new contributions also include a collection of case studies. Results on the MFEM finite-element library include variability/performance tradeoffs, and the identification of a (hitherto unknown) abnormal level of result-variability even under mild compiler optimizations. Results from studying the Laghos proxy application include identifying a significantly divergent floating-point result-variability and successful root-causing down to the problematic function over as little as 14 program executions. Finally, in an evaluation of 4,376 controlled injections of floating-point perturbations on the LULESH proxy application, we showed that the FLiT framework has 100 precision and recall in discovering the file and function locations of the injections all within an average of only 15 program executions.

We train and evaluate the method on various datasets, using manual annotations where available and solo instrument parts where not.

Observations of animal trajectories using telemetry devices provide researchers with information about the way animals interact with their environment and each other. For many species, specific geographical features in the landscape can have a strong effect on behavior. Such features may correspond to a single point (e.g., dens or kill sites), or to higher-dimensional subspaces (e.g., rivers or lakes). Features may be relatively static in time (e.g., coastlines or home-range centers), or may be dynamic (e.g., sea ice extent or areas of high-quality forage for herbivores). We introduce a novel model for animal movement that incorporates active selection for dynamic features in a landscape.   Our approach is motivated by the study of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) movement. During the sea ice melt season, polar bears spend much of their time on sea ice above shallow, biologically productive water where they hunt seals. The changing distribution and characteristics of sea ice throughout the late spring through early fall means that the location of valuable habitat is constantly shifting. We develop a model for the movement of polar bears that accounts for the effect of this important landscape feature. We introduce a two-stage procedure for approximate Bayesian inference that allows us to analyze over 300,000 observed locations of 186 polar bears from 2012--2016.

Several features make the proposed methodology particularly appealing for applications: we construct targeting rules that depend on an arbitrary set of individual, neighbors' and network characteristics, and we allow for general constraints on the policy function; we consider heterogeneous direct and spillover effects, arbitrary, possibly non-linear, regression models, and we propose estimators that are robust to model misspecification; the method flexibly accommodates for cases where researchers only observe local information of the network. From a theoretical perspective, we establish the first set of guarantees on the utilitarian regret under interference, and we show that it achieves the min-max optimal rate in scenarios of practical and theoretical interest.

A Traffic Analysis Perspective", "description": "  Virtually every connection to an Internet service is preceded by a DNS lookup. These lookups are performed in the clear without integrity protection, enabling manipulation, redirection, surveillance, and censorship. In parallel with standardization efforts that address these issues, large providers such as Google and Cloudflare are deploying solutions to encrypt lookups, such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). In this paper we examine whether encrypting DoH traffic can protect users from traffic analysis-based monitoring and censoring. We find that performing traffic analysis on DoH traces requires different features than those used to attack HTTPS or Tor traffic. We propose a new feature set tailored to the characteristics of DoH traffic. Our classifiers obtain an F1-score of 0.9 and 0.7 in closed and open world settings, respectively. We show that although factors such as location, resolver, platform, or client affect performance, they are far from completely deterring the attacks. We then study deployed countermeasures and show that, in contrast with web traffic, Tor effectively protects users. Specified defenses, however, still preserve patterns and leave some webs unprotected. Finally, we show that web censorship is still possible by analysing DoH traffic and discuss how to selectively block content with low collateral damage.

The certificate is realized through a stochastic tube that safely connects the current system state with a terminal set of states, that is known to be safe. A novel formulation in terms of a convex receding horizon problem allows a recursively feasible real-time computation of such probabilistic tubes, despite the presence of possibly unbounded disturbances. A design procedure for PMPSC relying on bayesian inference and recent advances in probabilistic set invariance is presented.

Many attempts, such as decreasing an adaptive learning rate, adopting a big batch size, incorporating a temporal decorrelation technique, seeking an analogous surrogate, etc., have been tried to promote Adam/RMSProp-type algorithms to converge. In contrast with existing approaches, we introduce an alternative easy-to-check sufficient condition, which merely depends on the parameters of the base learning rate and combinations of historical second-order moments, to guarantee the global convergence of generic Adam/RMSProp for solving large-scale non-convex stochastic optimization. Moreover, we show that the convergences of several variants of Adam, such as AdamNC, AdaEMA, etc., can be directly implied via the proposed sufficient condition in the non-convex setting. In addition, we illustrate that Adam is essentially a specifically weighted AdaGrad with exponential moving average momentum, which provides a novel perspective for understanding Adam and RMSProp. This observation coupled with this sufficient condition gives much deeper interpretations on their divergences. At last, we validate the sufficient condition by applying Adam and RMSProp to tackle a certain counterexample and train deep neural networks.

Conditional on the inferred hyperparameters, we make a fully Bayesian treatment of the main parameters of interest, that is, the brain activity coefficients. We apply the Mat\\'ern prior to both experimental and simulated task-fMRI data and clearly demonstrate that this is a more reasonable choice than the previously used priors, by using prior simulation, cross validation and visual inspection of the resulting activation maps.

We fit a simple bi-linear model to the evolution of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H], where X represents each of the elements mentioned above. We use the evolution of [Mg/Fe] coupled with theoretical supernova yields to isolate what fraction of the elements originated in SNe Ia. Then, we infer the [X/Fe] yield of SNe Ia for all of the elements except Mg. We compare these observationally inferred yields to recent theoretical predictions for two classes of Chandrasekhar-mass (M_Ch) SN Ia as well as sub-M_Ch SNe Ia. Most of the inferred SN Ia yields are consistent with all of the theoretical models, but [Ni/Fe] is consistent only with sub-M_Ch models. We conclude that the dominant type of SN Ia in ancient dwarf galaxies is the explosion of a sub-M_Ch white dwarf. The Milky Way and dwarf galaxies with extended star formation histories have higher [Ni/Fe] abundances, which could indicate that the dominant class of SN Ia is different for galaxies where star formation lasted for at least several Gyr.

While the finite-sample-size measure RE is useful to analyze the small sample behavior of detectors, in practice it is difficult to compute. In the limit as the signal strength approaches zero at an appropriate rate, the RE converges to an asymptotic limit only for very large sample sizes. This limiting ratio of the number of samples is the ARE, which lends analytical tractability, but does not provide insights into the finite sample behavior of detectors which is important for practical applications. This led researchers to study the convergence of RE to ARE, and has been well-reported for the problem of constant signal detection in additive, independent, and identically distributed noise. When the signal to be detected is random ({\\ie}, unknown), such a convergence analysis is lacking in the literature and is the focus of this paper.

The WD increases its mass by stable H burning and blows a strong wind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the accretion rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within CSM as an \"SN Ia-CSM\". 2. The wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under steady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft X-ray source: \"SN Ia-SSXS\". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The WD undergoes recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the accreted matter, evolving to an \"SN Ia-RN\". 4. If the companion is a He star or WD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at the sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while producing and He-wind: \"SN Ia-He CSM\". 5. If the accreting WD rotates rapidly, delayed trigger of an SN Ia beyond standard Chand mass can happen. The (super-Chand) WD contracts to become a delayed SN Ia after losing angular momentum. The companion star has become a He WD and CSM has disappeared: \"SN Ia-He WD\". We update nucleosynthesis yields of the carbon deflagration model W7, delayed detonation model WDD2, and the sub-Chand mass model to constrain the yields (such as Mn) by comparing the observations. We note the important metallicity effects on $^{58}$Ni and $^{55}$Mn.

These modes are unmatched in terms of field enhancement and spatial confinement, and dynamical all-optical control can be achieved e.g. by employing phase-change materials (PCMs). However, the excitation of surface polaritons in planar structures is intrinsically limited to p-polarization. On the contrary, waveguide modes in high-permittivity films can couple to both p- and s-polarized light, and in thin films, their confinement can become comparable to surface polaritons. Here we demonstrate that the s-polarized waveguide mode in a thin Ge$_3$Sb$_2$Te$_6$ (GST) film features a similar dispersion, confinement, and electric field enhancement as the SPhP mode of the silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, while even expanding the allowed frequency range. Moreover, we experimentally show that switching the GST film grants non-volatile control over the SPhP and the waveguide mode dispersions. We provide an analytical model for the description of the GST/SiC waveguide mode and show that our concept is applicable to the broad variety of polar crystals throughout the infrared spectral range. As such, complementarily to the polarization-limited surface polaritons, the s-polarized PCM waveguide mode constitutes a promising additional building block for nanophotonic applications.

We are convinced it is time to develop more relationships between these two communities through joint symposia, workshops, conferences, as well as to introduce some courses in magnetism and spin electronics in the education of young microelectronics engineers.

However, previous works do not consider the practical issues when deploying G2P model in the production system, such as how to leverage additional unlabeled data to boost the accuracy, as well as reduce model size for online deployment. In this work, we propose token-level ensemble distillation for G2P conversion, which can (1) boost the accuracy by distilling the knowledge from additional unlabeled data, and (2) reduce the model size but maintain the high accuracy, both of which are very practical and helpful in the online production system. We use token-level knowledge distillation, which results in better accuracy than the sequence-level counterpart. What is more, we adopt the Transformer instead of RNN or CNN based models to further boost the accuracy of G2P conversion.

This work investigates persistence of excitation conditions for discrete-time nonlinear systems that can be represented using Koopman operators. The Koopman operator presents a linear lifted representation of the evolution of a nonlinear system over a space of observable functions. We use this framework to derive spectral conditions for persistence of excitation, relating classical notions of persistence of excitation to the spectral properties of initial conditions, seen through the lens of Koopman observable functions. We illustrate these concepts on a repressilator circuit, a classical biological system from the field of synthetic biology, to motivate the proper selection of initial conditions.

This paper explores the possibility to perform asteroid mining operations with spacecraft that have a mass under 500 kg and deliver 100 kg of water per trip. The mining process considers water extraction through microwave heating with an efficiency of 2 Wh/g.The proposed, small spacecraft can reach NEAs within a range of $\\sim 0.03$ AU relative to earth's orbit, offering a delta V of 437 m/s per one-way trip.   A high-level systems engineering and economic analysis provides a closed spacecraft design as a baseline and puts the cost of the proposed spacecraft at $ 113.6 million/unit. The results indicate that more than one hundred spacecraft and their successful operation for over five years are required to achieve a financial break-even point. Pros and cons of using small spacecraft swarms are highlighted and the uncertainties associated with cost and profit of space related business ventures are analyzed.

This observation has led to a variety of connections between RL and inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Here we explore a different dimension to this relationship, examining reinforcement learning using the tools and abstractions of statistical physics. The central object in the statistical physics abstraction is the idea of a partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$, and here we construct a partition function from the ensemble of possible trajectories that an agent might take in a Markov decision process. Although value functions and $Q$-functions can be derived from this partition function and interpreted via average energies, the $\\mathcal{Z}$-function provides an object with its own Bellman equation that can form the basis of alternative dynamic programming approaches. Moreover, when the MDP dynamics are deterministic, the Bellman equation for $\\mathcal{Z}$ is linear, allowing direct solutions that are unavailable for the nonlinear equations associated with traditional value functions. The policies learned via these $\\mathcal{Z}$-based Bellman updates are tightly linked to Boltzmann-like policy parameterizations. In addition to sampling actions proportionally to the exponential of the expected cumulative reward as Boltzmann policies would, these policies take entropy into account favoring states from which many outcomes are possible.

Because outgoing radiation is forced to increase with surface temperature by the expansion of the radiative surface, we find that these worlds do not experience a runaway greenhouse. Further we show that a long-lived liquid water habitable zone is possible for low-gravity waterworlds of sufficient mass.

For sources fainter than 16th magnitude this is achieved thanks to Gaia's direct observations of quasars. At brighter magnitudes it is difficult to validate the quality of the reference frame due to the scarcity of comparison data. This paper examines the use of VLBI observations of radio stars to determine the spin and orientation of the bright reference frame of Gaia. Simultaneous estimation of the six spin and orientation parameters makes optimal use of VLBI data and makes it possible to include even single-epoch VLBI observations in the solution. The method is applied to Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) using published VLBI data for 41 radio stars. Results for the 26 best-fitting sources indicate that the bright reference frame of Gaia DR2 is rotating relative to the faint quasars at a rate of about 0.1 mas/yr, significant at 2-sigma level. This supports a similar conclusion based on a comparison with stellar positions in the Hipparcos frame. The accuracy is currently limited by the small number of radio sources used, by uncertainties in the Gaia DR2 proper motions, and by the astrophysical nature of the radio stars. While the origin of the indicated rotation is understood and can be avoided in future data releases, it remains important to validate the bright reference frame of Gaia by independent observations. This can be achieved using VLBI astrometry, which may require re-observing the old sample of radio stars as well as measuring new objects. The unique historical value of positional measurements is stressed and VLBI observers are urged to ensure that relevant positional information is preserved for the future.

With such an approach, for instance, we may see why a chimpanzee is classified as a chimpanzee, but not why it was considered to be a primate or even an animal. In this work we introduce a model that uses hierarchically organized prototypes to classify objects at every level in a predefined taxonomy. Hence, we may find distinct explanations for the prediction an image receives at each level of the taxonomy. The hierarchical prototypes enable the model to perform another important task: interpretably classifying images from previously unseen classes at the level of the taxonomy to which they correctly relate, e.g. classifying a hand gun as a weapon, when the only weapons in the training data are rifles. With a subset of ImageNet, we test our model against its counterpart black-box model on two tasks: 1) classification of data from familiar classes, and 2) classification of data from previously unseen classes at the appropriate level in the taxonomy.

Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we identify two different regimes, depending on the Fermi momentum of light fermions ($k_F$) and the boson-fermion scattering length $a_s(<0)$, where the presence of underlying Fermi sea plays distinct roles in the Efimov-type binding of bosons. Namely, in the regime $k_F|a_s|\\lesssim 1$ ($k_F|a_s|\\gtrsim1$), the Fermi sea induces an attractive (repulsive) effective interaction between bosons and thus favors (disfavors) the formation of bound state, which can be seen as the Efimov trimer dressed by the fermion cloud. Interestingly, this implies a non-monotonic behavior of these bound states as increasing the fermion density (or $k_F$). Moreover, we establish a generalized universal scaling law for the emergence/variation of such dressed Efimov bound states when incorporating a new scale ($k_F$) brought by the Fermi sea. These results can be directly tested in Li-Cs cold atoms experiment by measuring the modified bound state spectrum and the shifted Efimov resonance, which manifest an emergent non-trivial Efimov correlation in a fermionic many-body environment.

Despite outstanding overall performance, U-net ignores the contribution of all semantic strengths in the segmentation procedure. In the present study, we have proposed a novel architecture to tackle this drawback.

However, automated nuclear segmentation and classification is faced with a major challenge in that there are several different types of nuclei, some of them exhibiting large intra-class variability such as the tumour cells. Additionally, some of the nuclei are often clustered together. To address these challenges, we present a novel convolutional neural network for simultaneous nuclear segmentation and classification that leverages the instance-rich information encoded within the vertical and horizontal distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass. These distances are then utilised to separate clustered nuclei, resulting in an accurate segmentation, particularly in areas with overlapping instances. Then for each segmented instance, the network predicts the type of nucleus via a devoted up-sampling branch.

In this review, theory and experiment are critically compared and this confrontation leads to several important conclusions. The theoretically predicted trends nowadays reproduce the experimental findings quite well for series of molecules with a single well-defined control parameter, such as the length of the molecules. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiment usually is less convincing, however. Many reasons for quantitative discrepancies can be identified, from which one may decide that qualitative agreement is the best one may expect with present modeling tools. For further progress, benchmark systems are required that are sufficiently well-defined by experiment to allow quantitative testing of the approximation schemes underlying the theoretical modeling. Several key experiments can be identified suggesting that the present description may even be qualitatively incomplete in some cases.

A-MIMO-RoC, by leveraging a fully analog implementation, completely avoids any dedicated digital interface by using a transparent end-to-end system, with consequent latency, bandwidth and cost benefits. Usually, LAN cables are exploited mainly in the low-frequency spectrum portion, mostly due to the moderate cable attenuation and crosstalk among twisted-pairs. Unlike current systems based on LAN cables, the key feature of the proposed platform is to exploit more efficiently the huge bandwidth capability offered by LAN cables, that contain 4 twisted-pairs reaching up to 500 MHz bandwidth/pair when the length is below 100 m. Several works proposed numerical simulations that assert the feasibility of employing LAN cables for indoor FH applications up to several hundreds of MHz, but an A-MIMO-RoC experimental evaluation is still missing.

Most state-of-the-art approaches prune the model in filter-level according to the \"importance\" of filters. Despite their success, we notice they suffer from at least two of the following problems: 1) The redundancy among filters is not considered because the importance is evaluated independently. 2) Cross-layer filter comparison is unachievable since the importance is defined locally within each layer. Consequently, we must manually specify layer-wise pruning ratios. 3) They are prone to generate sub-optimal solutions because they neglect the inequality between reducing parameters and reducing computational cost. Reducing the same number of parameters in different positions in the network may reduce different computational cost. To address the above problems, we develop a novel algorithm named as COP (correlation-based pruning), which can detect the redundant filters efficiently. We enable the cross-layer filter comparison through global normalization. We add parameter-quantity and computational-cost regularization terms to the importance, which enables the users to customize the compression according to their preference (smaller or faster).

Studying such questions not only gives detailed insight into the structure of the problem itself, but also into the complexity of related problems; most notably graph theory's core notion of critical graphs (e.g., graphs whose chromatic number decreases under deletion of an arbitrary edge) and the complexity-theoretic notion of minimality problems (also called criticality problems, e.g., recognizing graphs that become 3-colorable when an arbitrary edge is deleted).   We focus on two prototypical graph problems, Colorability and Vertex Cover. For example, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal coloring for a graph from optimal colorings for all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, and that this remains true even when optimal solutions for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs are given. In contrast, computing an optimal coloring from all (or even just two) one-edge-added supergraphs is in P. We observe that Vertex Cover exhibits a remarkably different behavior, demonstrating the power of our model to delineate problems from each other more precisely on a structural level.

By exploiting the exceptionally rich datasets recorded by modern video games--which provide information on the individual behavior of each and every player--survival analysis techniques can be used to predict what players are more likely to become paying (or even premium) users and when, both in terms of time and game level, the conversion will take place. Here we show that a traditional semi-parametric model (Cox regression), a random survival forest (RSF) technique and a method based on conditional inference survival ensembles all yield very promising results. However, the last approach has the advantage of being able to correct the inherent bias in RSF models by dividing the procedure into two steps: first selecting the best predictor to perform the splitting and then the best split point for that covariate. The proposed conditional inference survival ensembles method could be readily used in operational environments for early identification of premium players and the parts of the game that may prompt them to become paying users. Such knowledge would allow developers to induce their conversion and, more generally, to better understand the needs of their players and provide them with a personalized experience, thereby increasing their engagement and paving the way to higher monetization.

Systems that employ redundancy has drawn significant attention, and numerous papers have analyzed the pain and gain of redundancy under various service models and assumptions on the runtime variability. This paper presents a cost (pain) vs. latency (gain) analysis of executing jobs of many tasks by employing replicated or erasure coded redundancy. Tail heaviness of service time variability is decisive on the pain and gain of redundancy and we quantify its effect by deriving expressions for the cost and latency. Specifically, we try to answer four questions: 1) How do replicated and coded redundancy compare in the cost vs. latency tradeoff? 2) Can we introduce redundancy after waiting some time and expect to reduce the cost? 3) Can relaunching the tasks that appear to be straggling after some time help to reduce cost and/or latency? 4) Is it effective to use redundancy and relaunching together?

Moreover, for each of these domains, we identify two distinct `types' of scrambling; genuine scrambling, where an initial operator localized in phase space spreads out and quasi scrambling, where a local ensemble of operators distorts but the overall phase space volume remains fixed.

The proposed approach employs a pre-trained convolution neural network and transfer learning to extract features from video frames that capture the emotional content. For the auditory content, a minimalistic set of parameters such as prosodic, excitation, vocal tract, and spectral descriptors are used as features. The fusion of these two modalities is carried out at a feature level, before training a single support vector regressor (SVR) or at a prediction level, after training one SVR for each modality. The proposed approach also includes preprocessing and post-processing techniques which contribute favorably to improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Experimental results for predicting spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA dataset have shown that the proposed approach takes advantage of the complementary information of visual and auditory modalities and provides CCCs of 0.749 and 0.565 for arousal and valence, respectively.

However, to apply traditional portfolio optimization models, analysts must use historical (or simulated/expected) return data as the basis for their calculations. Our paper develops an alternative portfolio optimization framework that is able to handle this kind of information (given by the ordinal ranking of investment alternatives) and to calculate an optimal capital allocation based on a Cobb-Douglas function. Considering risk-neutral investors, we show that the results of this portfolio optimization model usually outperform the output generated by the (intuitive) Equally Weighted Portfolio (EWP) of the different investment alternatives, which is the result of optimization when one is unable to incorporate additional data (the ordinal ranking of the alternatives).

For static droplets, the pressure difference $P_{\\varepsilon, in} - P_{\\varepsilon, out}$ satisfies the Young-Laplace law for droplet radius greater than $3.5\\varepsilon$ and otherwise deviates from the Young-Laplace law. The latter indicates that the surface tension in the proposed model decreases with decreasing radius of curvature, which agrees with molecular dynamics and experimental studies of nanodroplets. Using the non-local model we perform numerical simulations of droplets under dynamic conditions, including a rising droplet, a droplet in shear flow, and two colliding droplets in shear flow, and compare results with a standard Navier-Stokes model subject to the Young-Laplace boundary condition at the fluid-fluid interface implemented via the Conservative Level Set (CLS) method. We find good agreement with existing numerical methods and analytical results for a rising macroscopic droplet and a droplet in a shear flow.

A review of the existing literature on agricultural ontologies, however, reveals that most of the studies, which propose agricultural ontologies, are lacking an explicit evaluation procedure. This is undesired because without well-structured evaluation processes, it is difficult to consider the value of ontologies to research and practice. Moreover, it is difficult to rely on such ontologies and share them on the Semantic Web or between semantic aware applications. With the growing number of ontology-based agricultural systems and the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web, it becomes essential that such development and evaluation methods are put forward to guide future efforts of ontology development.

Thanks to the previously determined mass and distance constraints of the neutron star PSR~J1909--3744, and its predominantly thermal emission, deep observations of this object with future X-ray facilities should provide useful constraints on the neutron star equation of state.

In this paper, the hybrid precoding technique is employed to improve the secure energy efficiency of the IoT network. A secure energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated for the IoT network. Due to the non-convexity of the problem and the feasible domain, the problem is firstly transformed into a tractable suboptimal form. Then a secure hybrid precoding energy efficient (SEEHP) algorithm is proposed to tackle the problem. Numerical results indicate that the proposed SEEHP algorithm achieves higher secure energy efficiency compared with three existing physical layer security algorithms, especially when the number of transmit antennas is large.

In the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, a sensor must be capable of detecting, or even mitigating the harmful effects of interference, which include a decreased detection sensitivity.

The average Nusselt number shows a positive dependence on both Gr and Pr whereas it shows an adverse dependence on Power-law index (n). Overall, shear-thinning (n<1) fluid behavior promotes the convection whereas shear-thickening (n>1) behavior impedes it with reference to a Newtonian fluid (n=1).

Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range log(Mh/Msun) ~ 10-12 , and we focus on z=0.25 and z=2. Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ~L* halos retain a baryon mass >~50% of their cosmic budget. Metals are more efficiently retained by halos, with a retention fraction >~50%. Across all masses and redshifts analyzed >~60% of the CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with infalling halos). Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ~L* halos. Gas can persist in the CGM for billions of years, resulting in well-mixed halo gas. Sight lines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. For low-redshift ~L* halos, cool gas (T<10^4.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability. The metallicity of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by >~1 dex), although CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion. Our results highlight the multiple physical mechanisms that contribute to the CGM and will inform observational efforts to develop a cohesive picture.

The fraction of inflowing rest mass energy emitted as light, the radiative efficiency, has been inferred to be 10\\%, in agreement with expectations from thin disk accretion models. But the existence of billion solar-mass SMBHs powering quasars at $z > 7$ challenges this picture: provided they respect the Eddington limit, there is not enough time to grow $z>7$ SMBHs from stellar remnant seeds unless the radiative efficiency is below 10\\%. Here we show that one can constrain the radiative efficiencies of the most distant quasars known using foreground neutral intergalactic gas as a cosmological-scale ionizing photon counter.

(2) The design of a stellarator is actually improved when the central region of the plasma has rapid transport with the confinement provided by a surrounding annulus of magnetic surfaces with low transport. (3) The stellarator is unique among all fusion concepts, inertial as well as magnetic, in not using the plasma itself to provide an essential part of its confinement concept. This permits reliable computational design, which opens a path to faster, cheaper, and more certain achievement of fusion energy.

By providing such a deep, high-resolution millimeter-wave survey (about 0.5 uK-arcmin noise and 15 arcsecond resolution at 150 GHz), CMB-HD will enable major advances. It will allow 1) the use of gravitational lensing of the primordial microwave background to map the distribution of matter on small scales (k~10/hMpc), which probes dark matter particle properties. It will also allow 2) measurements of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects on small scales to map the gas density and gas pressure profiles of halos over a wide field, which probes galaxy evolution and cluster astrophysics. In addition, CMB-HD would allow us to cross critical thresholds in fundamental physics: 3) ruling out or detecting any new, light (< 0.1eV), thermal particles, which could potentially be the dark matter, and 4) testing a wide class of multi-field models that could explain an epoch of inflation in the early Universe. Such a survey would also 5) monitor the transient sky by mapping the full observing region every few days, which opens a new window on gamma-ray bursts, novae, fast radio bursts, and variable active galactic nuclei. Moreover, CMB-HD would 6) provide a census of planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids in the outer Solar System, and 7) enable the detection of exo-Oort clouds around other solar systems, shedding light on planet formation. CMB-HD will deliver this survey in 5 years of observing half the sky, using two new 30-meter-class off-axis cross-Dragone telescopes to be located at Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert. The telescopes will field about 2.4 million detectors (600,000 pixels) in total.

Early tree algorithms (e.g., AID, CART) employed greedy search strategies, directly comparing all possible split points in all available covariates. However, subsequent research showed that this is biased towards selecting covariates with more potential split points. Therefore, unbiased recursive partitioning algorithms have been suggested (e.g., QUEST, GUIDE, CTree, MOB) that first select the covariate based on statistical inference using p-values that are adjusted for the possible split points. In a second step a split point optimizing some objective function is selected in the chosen split variable. However, different unbiased tree algorithms obtain these p-values from different inference frameworks and their relative advantages or disadvantages are not well understood, yet. Therefore, three different popular approaches are considered here: classical categorical association tests (as in GUIDE), conditional inference (as in CTree), and parameter instability tests (as in MOB). First, these are embedded into a common inference framework encompassing parametric model trees, in particular linear model trees. Second, it is assessed how different building blocks from this common framework affect the power of the algorithms to select the appropriate covariates for splitting: observation-wise goodness-of-fit measure (residuals vs. model scores), dichotomization of residuals/scores at zero, and binning of possible split variables. This shows that specifically the goodness-of-fit measure is crucial for the power of the procedures, with model scores without dichotomization performing much better in many scenarios.

We study the effect of the long-range interactions on the bandwidth and the van Hove singularities of the low energy bands of twisted graphene bilayers. Reasonable values of the long-range electrostatic interaction lead to a band dispersion with a significant dependence on the filling. The change of the shape and position of the bands with electronic filling implies that the van Hove singularities remain close to the Fermi energy for a broad range of fillings.
